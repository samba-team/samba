Directory	Notes:
=========	======

docs		(Samba Documentation):
----		----------------------

	The Samba documentation for the 2.2 release has had all the man pages
	converted to DocBook v4.1 source format. Because of this the man pages
	are now available in both traditional man page format (in
	the doc/manpages directory) and in HTML format (in the 
	docs/htmldocs directory).

	The text documentation files have been moved into a
	docs/textdocs directory and are in the (slow) process
	of being converted to DocBook source format to allow them
	to be easily converted to HTML.
    
	Note in particular two files - docs/textdocs/<your OS>_INSTALL.txt 
	and docs/textdocs/DIAGNOSIS.txt.

	There is the potential for there to be many *INSTALL.txt files, one
	for each OS that Samba supports. However we are moving all this into
	the new structure. For now, most people will be using 
	htmldocs/UNIX_INSTALL.txt

	Please pay close attention to all the files with a .txt extension
	in the docs/textdocs directory and the htmldocs/* files. Most problems 
	can be solved by reference to the two files mentioned.

	The FAQ documentation can be accessed starting from Samba-meta-FAQ.html,
	in the docs/faq directory. This is incomplete, but to quote from the 
	abstract, it:
	
	"contains overview information for the Samba suite of programs, 
	a quick-start guide, and pointers to all other Samba documentation. 
	Other FAQs exist for specific client and server issues, and HOWTO 
	documents for more extended topics to do with Samba software."


examples	(Example configuration files):
--------	------------------------------

	Please pay close attention to the reference smb.conf file
	smb.conf.default that has now been included as the master guide.

	Do read the smb.conf manual page in considering what settings are
	appropriate for your site.

	There are lots of interesting examples of how people have been able
	to implement Samba for their use. Users may also be interested in
	the VFS (Virtual File System) modules under this directory.

SWAT:		The Samba Web Administration Tool
-----		---------------------------------

	SWAT is a web based tool for configuring and optimising the smb.conf
	file. To use it, you need to have SWAT enabled in your inetd control
	file (for more information check the packaging directories for examples
	of how this can be done). Then you connect to SWAT using your favourite
	web browser - point it at http://hostname:901, then log on as "root"
	using the root password. If you log on using a non-root account SWAT
	will not allow the smb.conf file to be changed.


packaging	(Only for those wishing to build binary distributions):
---------	-------------------------------------------------------

	Currently support is included for the following Linux Distributions :
	
		Caldera, RedHat, SuSE, Mandrake, and TurboLinux.

	Packaging support for TuboLinux is under ~samba/packaging/PHT - the
	previous name of the company was Pacific HiTech, hence the PHT.

	In addition, packaging support is available for SGI and Solaris systems.

	SCO OpenServer and SCO UnixWare have been acquired by Caldera. We expect
	that Caldera will in future integrate Samba into the above operating
	systems. UnixWare has been renamed to OpenUnix. Look under the directory
	~samba/packaging/Caldera for packaging support for these platforms.

	We hope that other Unix OS vendors will contribute their binary
	distribution packaging control files - and we hope to make their binary
	packages available on the master ftp site under:

		ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/Binary_Packages/"OS_Vendor"


source		(The official Samba source files - expect more of these!):
------		----------------------------------------------------------

	To build your own binary files you will need a suitable ansi C
	compiler.

	For Samba 2.2 the GNU autoconf system has been adopted. In
	order to build a default Samba for your platform cd into
	the source/ directory and then type :

		./configure

	followed by :

		make

	To install the binaries built by the above type :

		make install
 
	then set up your configuration files.

	NOTE: OS Vendors who provide Samba binary packages will generally
	integrate all Samba files into their preferred directory locations.
	These may differ from the default location ALWAYS used by the Samba
	sources. Please be careful when upgrading a vendor provided binary
	distribution from files you have built yourself.
