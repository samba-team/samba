Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first pre release of Samba 4.22.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.22 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

SMB3 Directory Leases
---------------------

Starting with Samba 4.22 SMB3 Directory Leases are supported. The new global
option "smb3 directory leases" controls whether the feature is enabled or
not. By default, SMB3 Directory Leases are enabled on non-clustered Samba and
disabled on clustered Samba, based on the "clustering" option. See man smb.conf
for more details.

SMB3 Directory Leases allow clients to cache directory listings and, depending
on the workload, result in a decent reduction in SMB requests from clients.

Netlogon Ping over LDAP and LDAPS
---------------------------------

Samba must query domain controller information via simple queries on
the AD rootdse's netlogon attribute. Typically this is done via
connectionless LDAP, using UDP on port 389. The same information is
also available via classic LDAP rootdse queries over TCP. Samba can
now be configured to use TCP via the new "client netlogon ping
protocol" parameter to enable running in environments where firewalls
completely block port 389 or UDP traffic to domain controllers.

REMOVED FEATURES
================

The "nmbd proxy logon" feature was removed. This was used before
Samba4 acquired a NBT server.

The parameter "cldap port" has been removed. CLDAP runs over UDP port
389, we don't see a reason why this should ever be changed to a
different port. Moreover, we had several places in the code where
Samba did not respect this parameter, so the behaviour was at least
inconsistent.

fruit:posix_rename
------------------

This option of the vfs_fruit VFS module that could be used to enable POSIX
directory rename behaviour for OS X clients has been removed as it could result
in severe problems for Windows clients.

As a possible workaround it is possible to prevent creation of .DS_Store files
(a Finder thingy to store directory view settings) on network mounts by running

  $ defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true

on the Mac.
