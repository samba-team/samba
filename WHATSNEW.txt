Samba 4.8 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

Using x86_64 Accelerated AES Crypto Instructions
================================================

Samba on x86_64 can now be configured to use the Intel accelerated AES
instruction set, which has the potential to make SMB3 signing and
encryption much faster on client and server. To enable this, configure
Samba using the new option --accel-aes=intelaesni.

This is a temporary solution that is being included to allow users
to enjoy the benefits of Intel accelerated AES on the x86_64 platform,
but the longer-term solution will be to move Samba to a fully supported
external crypto library.

The third_party/aesni-intel code will be removed from Samba as soon as
external crypto library performance reaches parity.

The default is to build without setting --accel-aes, which uses the
existing Samba software AES implementation.
