Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first stable release of the Samba 4.4 release series.


UPGRADING
=========

Nothing special.


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

Asynchronous flush requests
---------------------------

Flush requests from SMB2/3 clients are handled asynchronously and do
not block the processing of other requests. Note that 'strict sync'
has to be set to 'yes' for Samba to honor flush requests from SMB
clients.

s3: smbd
--------

Remove '--with-aio-support' configure option. We no longer would ever prefer
POSIX-RT aio, use pthread_aio instead.

samba-tool sites
----------------

The 'samba-tool sites' subcommand can now be run against another server by
specifying an LDB URL using the '-H' option and not against the local database
only (which is still the default when no URL is given).

samba-tool domain demote
------------------------

Add '--remove-other-dead-server' option to 'samba-tool domain demote'
subcommand. The new version of this tool now can remove another DC that is
itself offline.  The '--remove-other-dead-server' removes as many references
to the DC as possible.

samba-tool drs clone-dc-database
--------------------------------

Replicate an initial clone of domain, but do not join it.
This is developed for debugging purposes, but not for setting up another DC.

pdbedit
-------

Add '--set-nt-hash' option to pdbedit to update user password from nt-hash
hexstring. 'pdbedit -vw' shows also password hashes.

smbstatus
---------

'smbstatus' was enhanced to show the state of signing and encryption for
sessions and shares.

smbget
------
The -u and -p options for user and password were replaced by the -U option that
accepts username[%password] as in many other tools of the Samba suite.
Similary, smbgetrc files do not accept username and password options any more,
only a single "user" option which also accepts user%password combinations.
The -P option was removed.

s4-rpc_server
-------------

Add a GnuTLS based backupkey implementation.

ntlm_auth
---------

Using the '--offline-logon' enables ntlm_auth to use cached passwords when the
DC is offline.

Allow '--password' force a local password check for ntlm-server-1 mode.

vfs_offline
-----------

A new VFS module called vfs_offline has been added to mark all files in the
share as offline. It can be useful for shares mounted on top of a remote file
system (either through a samba VFS module or via FUSE).

KCC
---

The Samba KCC has been improved, but is still disabled by default.

DNS
---

There were several improvements concerning the Samba DNS server.

Active Directory
----------------

There were some improvements in the Active Directory area.

WINS nsswitch module
--------------------

The WINS nsswitch module has been rewritten to address memory issues and to
simplify the code. The module now uses libwbclient to do WINS queries. This
means that winbind needs to be running in order to resolve WINS names using
the nss_wins module. This does not affect smbd.

CTDB changes
------------

* CTDB now uses a newly implemented parallel database recovery scheme
  that avoids deadlocks with smbd.

  In certain circumstances CTDB and smbd could deadlock.  The new
  recovery implementation avoid this.  It also provides improved
  recovery performance.

* All files are now installed into and referred to by the paths
  configured at build time.  Therefore, CTDB will now work properly
  when installed into the default location at /usr/local.

* Public CTDB header files are no longer installed, since Samba and
  CTDB are built from within the same source tree.

* CTDB_DBDIR can now be set to tmpfs[:<tmpfs-options>]

  This will cause volatile TDBs to be located in a tmpfs.  This can
  help to avoid performance problems associated with contention on the
  disk where volatile TDBs are usually stored.  See ctdbd.conf(5) for
  more details.

* Configuration variable CTDB_NATGW_SLAVE_ONLY is no longer used.
  Instead, nodes should be annotated with the "slave-only" option in
  the CTDB NAT gateway nodes file.  This file must be consistent
  across nodes in a NAT gateway group.  See ctdbd.conf(5) for more
  details.

* New event script 05.system allows various system resources to be
  monitored

  This can be helpful for explaining poor performance or unexpected
  behaviour.  New configuration variables are
  CTDB_MONITOR_FILESYSTEM_USAGE, CTDB_MONITOR_MEMORY_USAGE and
  CTDB_MONITOR_SWAP_USAGE.  Default values cause warnings to be
  logged.  See the SYSTEM RESOURCE MONITORING CONFIGURATION in
  ctdbd.conf(5) for more information.

  The memory, swap and filesystem usage monitoring previously found in
  00.ctdb and 40.fs_use is no longer available.  Therefore,
  configuration variables CTDB_CHECK_FS_USE, CTDB_MONITOR_FREE_MEMORY,
  CTDB_MONITOR_FREE_MEMORY_WARN and CTDB_CHECK_SWAP_IS_NOT_USED are
  now ignored.

* The 62.cnfs eventscript has been removed.  To get a similar effect
  just do something like this:

      mmaddcallback ctdb-disable-on-quorumLoss \
        --command /usr/bin/ctdb \
        --event quorumLoss --parms "disable"

      mmaddcallback ctdb-enable-on-quorumReached \
        --command /usr/bin/ctdb \
        --event quorumReached --parms "enable"

* The CTDB tunable parameter EventScriptTimeoutCount has been renamed
  to MonitorTimeoutCount

  It has only ever been used to limit timed-out monitor events.

  Configurations containing CTDB_SET_EventScriptTimeoutCount=<n> will
  cause CTDB to fail at startup.  Useful messages will be logged.

* The commandline option "-n all" to CTDB tool has been removed.

  The option was not uniformly implemented for all the commands.
  Instead of command "ctdb ip -n all", use "ctdb ip all".

* All CTDB current manual pages are now correctly installed


EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
=====================

SMB3 Multi-Channel
------------------

Samba 4.4.0 adds *experimental* support for SMB3 Multi-Channel.
Multi-Channel is an SMB3 protocol feature that allows the client
to bind multiple transport connections into one authenticated
SMB session. This allows for increased fault tolerance and
throughput. The client chooses transport connections as reported
by the server and also chooses over which of the bound transport
connections to send traffic. I/O operations for a given file
handle can span multiple network connections this way.
An SMB multi-channel session will be valid as long as at least
one of its channels are up.

In Samba, multi-channel can be enabled by setting the new
smb.conf option "server multi channel support" to "yes".
It is disabled by default.

Samba has to report interface speeds and some capabilities to
the client. On Linux, Samba can auto-detect the speed of an
interface. But to support other platforms, and in order to be
able to manually override the detected values, the "interfaces"
smb.conf option has been given an extended syntax, by which an
interface specification can additionally carry speed and
capability information. The extended syntax looks like this
for setting the speed to 1 gigabit per second:

    interfaces = 192.168.1.42;speed=1000000000

This extension should be used with care and are mainly intended
for testing. See the smb.conf manual page for details.

CAVEAT: While this should be working without problems mostly,
there are still corner cases in the treatment of channel failures
that may result in DATA CORRUPTION when these race conditions hit.
It is hence

    NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE MULTI-CHANNEL IN PRODUCTION

at this stage. This situation can be expected to improve during
the life-time of the 4.4 release. Feed-back from test-setups is
highly welcome.
