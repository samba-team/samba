Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first release candidate of Samba 4.2.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.2 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========

Read the "Winbindd/Netlogon improvements" section (below) carefully!


NEW FEATURES
============

Transparent File Compression
============================

Samba 4.2.0 adds support for the manipulation of file and folder
compression flags on the Btrfs filesystem.
With the Btrfs Samba VFS module enabled, SMB2+ compression flags can
be set remotely from the Windows Explorer File->Properties->Advanced
dialog. Files flagged for compression are transparently compressed
and uncompressed when accessed or modified.

Previous File Versions with Snapper
===================================

The newly added Snapper VFS module exposes snapshots managed by
Snapper for use by Samba. This provides the ability for remote
clients to access shadow-copies via Windows Explorer using the
"previous versions" dialog.

Winbindd/Netlogon improvements
==============================

The whole concept of maintaining the netlogon secure channel
to (other) domain controllers was rewritten in order to maintain
global state in a netlogon_creds_cli.tdb. This is the proper fix
for a large number of bugs:

  https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7944
  https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7945
  https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7568
  https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8599

In addition a strong session key is now required by default,
which means that communication to older servers or clients
might be rejected by default.

For the client side we have the following new options:
"require strong key" (yes by default), "reject md5 servers" (no by default).
E.g. for Samba 3.0.37 you need "require strong key = no" and
for NT4 DCs you need "require strong key = no" and "client NTLMv2 auth = no",

On the server side (as domain controller) we have the following new options:
"allow nt4 crypto" (no by default), "reject md5 client" (no by default).
E.g. in order to allow Samba < 3.0.27 or NT4 members to work
you need "allow nt4 crypto = yes"

winbindd does not list group memberships for display purposes
(e.g. getent group <domain\<group>) anymore by default.
The new default is "winbind expand groups = 0" now,
the reason for this is the same as for "winbind enum users = no"
and "winbind enum groups = no". Providing this information is not always
reliably possible, e.g. if there are trusted domains.

Please consult the smb.conf manpage for more details on these new options.

Winbindd use on the Samba AD DC
===============================

Winbindd is now used on the Samba AD DC by default, replacing the
partial rewrite used for winbind operations in Samba 4.0 and 4.1.

This allows more code to be shared, more options to be honoured, and
paves the way for support for trusted domains in the AD DC.

If required the old internal winbind can be activated by setting
'server services = +winbind -winbindd'.  Upgrading users with a server
services parameter specified should ensure they change 'winbind' to
'winbindd' to obtain the new functionality.

The 'samba' binary still manages the starting of this service, there
is no need to start the winbindd binary manually.

Winbind now requires secured connections
========================================

To improve protection against rogue domain controllers we now require
that when we connect to an AD DC in our forest, that the connection be
signed using SMB Signing.  Set 'client signing = off' in the smb.conf
to disable.

Also and DCE/RPC pipes must be sealed, set 'require strong key =
false' and 'winbind sealed pipes = false' to disable.

Finally, the default for 'client ldap sasl wrapping' has been set to
'sign', to ensure the integrity of LDAP connections.  Set 'client ldap
sasl wrapping = plain' to disable.

Larger IO sizes for SMB2/3 by default
=====================================

The default values for "smb2 max read", "smb2 max write" and "smb2 max trans"
have been changed to 8388608 (8MiB) in order to match the default of
Windows 2012R2.

Improved DCERPC man in the middle detection
===========================================

The DCERPC header signing has been implemented
in addition to the dcerpc_sec_verification_trailer
protection.

Overhauled "net idmap" command
==============================

The command line interface of the "net idmap" command has been
made systematic, and subcommands for reading and writing the autorid idmap
database have been added. Note that the writing commands should be
used with great care. See the net(8) manual page for details.

tdb improvements
================

The tdb library, our core mechanism to store Samba-specific data on disk and
share it between processes, has been improved to support process shared robust
mutexes on Linux. These mutexes are available on Linux and Solaris and
significantly reduce the overhead involved with tdb. To enable mutexes for
tdb, set

dbwrap_tdb_mutexes:* = yes

in the [global] section of your smb.conf.

Tdb file space management has also been made more efficient. This
will lead to smaller and less fragmented databases.

Messaging improvements
======================

Our internal messaging subsystem, used for example for things like oplock
break messages between smbds or setting a process debug level dynamically, has
been rewritten to use unix domain datagram messages.

Clustering support
==================

Samba's file server clustering component CTDB is now integrated in the
Samba tree.  This avoids the confusion of compatibility of Samba and CTDB
versions as existed previously.

To build the Samba file server with cluster support, use the configure
command line option --with-cluster-support.  This will build clustered
file server against the in-tree ctdb.  Building clustered samba with
previous versions of CTDB is no longer supported.

CTDB is built separately from the ctdb/ sub-directory.  To build CTDB,
use the following steps:

  $ cd ctdb
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

Samba Registry Editor
=====================

The utitlity to browse the samba registry has been overhauled by our Google
Summer of Code student Chris Davis. Now samba-regedit has a
Midnight-Commander-like theme and UI experience. You can browse keys and edit
the diffent value types. For a data value type a hexeditor has been
implemented.

KNOWN ISSUES
============

Bad Password Lockout in the AD DC
=================================

Samba's AD DC now implements bad password lockout (on a per-DC basis).

That is, incorrect password attempts are tracked, and accounts locked
out if too many bad passwords are submitted.  There is also a grace
peroid of 60 on the previous password when used for NTLM
authentication (matching Windows 2003 SP1: https://support2.microsoft.com/kb/906305).

The relevant settings can be seen using 'samba-tool domain
passwordsettings show' (the new settings being highlighted):

Password informations for domain 'DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com'

Password complexity: on
Store plaintext passwords: off
Password history length: 24
Minimum password length: 7
Minimum password age (days): 1
Maximum password age (days): 42
* Account lockout duration (mins): 30     *
* Account lockout threshold (attempts): 0 *
* Reset account lockout after (mins): 30  *

These values can be set using 'samba-tool domain passwordsettings set'.

Correct defaults in the smb.conf manpages
=========================================

The default values for smb.conf parameters are now correctly specified
in the smb.conf manpage, even when they refer to build-time specified
paths.  Provided Samba is built on a system with the right tools
(xsltproc in particular) required to generate our man pages, then
these will be built with the exact same embedded paths as used by the
configuration parser at runtime.  Additionally, the default values
read from the smb.conf manpage is checked by a our test suite to match
the values seen in testparm and used by the running binaries.

Consistent behaviour between samba-tool testparm and testparm
=============================================================

With the exception of the registry backend, which remains only
available in the file server, the behaviour of the smb.conf parser and
the tools 'samba-tool testparm' and 'testparm' is now consistent,
particularly with regard to default values.  Except with regard to
registry shares, it is no longer needed to use one tool on the AD
DC, and another on the file server.
