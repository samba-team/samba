Release Announcements
=====================

This is the second release candidate release of Samba 4.23.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.23 will be the next version of the Samba suite.

samba-tool domain backup --no-secrets avoids confidential attributes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The --no-secrets option creates a back-up without secret attributes
(e.g. passwords), suitable for use in a lab domain. Until now it could
still contain confidential attributes, including BitLocker recovery
data and KDS root keys. Objects in the classes msKds-ProvRootKey,
msFVE-RecoveryInformation, and msTPM-InformationObject will now be
entirely removed from the backup, as these objects are required by
schema to have confidential attributes and are no use without them.

CTDB changes
------------

* CTDB now supports loading tunables from
  /etc/ctdb/tunables.d/*.tunables, in addition to the standard
  /etc/ctdb/tunables.conf.  See the ctdb-tunables(7) manual page for
  more details.  Note that the above locations are examples - the
  actual location of these files will depend on compile time
  configuration.

  It isn't expected that many users will require a directory of tunables
  files, since most users do not need to change tunables from their
  default values.  However, this allows vendors to ship their required
  tunables settings (for example, in one or more files marked "do not
  edit") while still allowing local administrators to add their own
  tunables settings (in one or more separate files).

Per-share profiling stats
-------------------------
Starting with Samba 4.23, users can collect profile counters at a
per-share level. This feature requires building Samba with profiling
data enabled and adding an appropriate `smb.conf` parameter for
specific shares. It's particularly useful for deployments with a large
number of active shares, allowing administrators to monitor individual
share activity and identify potential bottlenecks or hot-spots. When
enabled, users can inspect current per-share profile information
("Extended Profile") using the standard `smbstatus` utility.

Currently, this functionality is supported only by the default and
`ceph_new` VFS modules.
