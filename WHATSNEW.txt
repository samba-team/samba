                   ==============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.2.10
                           April 12, 2016
                   ==============================


This is a security release in order to address the following CVEs:

o  CVE-2015-5370 (Multiple errors in DCE-RPC code)

o  CVE-2016-2110 (Man in the middle attacks possible with NTLMSSP)

o  CVE-2016-2111 (NETLOGON Spoofing Vulnerability)

o  CVE-2016-2112 (LDAP client and server don't enforce integrity)

o  CVE-2016-2113 (Missing TLS certificate validation)

o  CVE-2016-2114 ("server signing = mandatory" not enforced)

o  CVE-2016-2115 (SMB IPC traffic is not integrity protected)

o  CVE-2016-2118 (SAMR and LSA man in the middle attacks possible)

The number of changes are rather huge for a security release,
compared to typical security releases.

Given the number of problems and the fact that they are all related
to man in the middle attacks we decided to fix them all at once
instead of splitting them.

In order to prevent the man in the middle attacks it was required
to change the (default) behavior for some protocols. Please see the
"New smb.conf options" and "Behavior changes" sections below.

=======
Details
=======

o  CVE-2015-5370

   Versions of Samba from 3.6.0 to 4.4.0 inclusive are vulnerable to
   denial of service attacks (crashes and high cpu consumption)
   in the DCE-RPC client and server implementations. In addition,
   errors in validation of the DCE-RPC packets can lead to a downgrade
   of a secure connection to an insecure one.

   The above applies all possible server roles Samba can operate in.

   Note that versions before 3.6.0 had completely different marshalling
   functions for the generic DCE-RPC layer. It's quite possible that
   that code has similar problems!

   The downgrade of a secure connection to an insecure one may
   allow an attacker to take control of Active Directory object
   handles created on a connection created from an Administrator
   account and re-use them on the now non-privileged connection,
   compromising the security of the Samba AD-DC.

o  CVE-2016-2110:

   There are several man in the middle attacks possible with
   NTLMSSP authentication.

   E.g. NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_SIGN and NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_SEAL
   can be cleared by a man in the middle.

   This was by protocol design in earlier Windows versions.

   Windows Server 2003 RTM and Vista RTM introduced a way
   to protect against the trivial downgrade.

   See MsvAvFlags and flag 0x00000002 in
   https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc236646.aspx

   This new feature also implies support for a mechlistMIC
   when used within SPNEGO, which may prevent downgrades
   from other SPNEGO mechs, e.g. Kerberos, if sign or
   seal is finally negotiated.

   The Samba implementation doesn't enforce the existence of
   required flags, which were requested by the application layer,
   e.g. LDAP or SMB1 encryption (via the unix extensions).
   As a result a man in the middle can take over the connection.
   It is also possible to misguide client and/or
   server to send unencrypted traffic even if encryption
   was explicitly requested.

   LDAP (with NTLMSSP authentication) is used as a client
   by various admin tools of the Samba project,
   e.g. "net", "samba-tool", "ldbsearch", "ldbedit", ...

   As an active directory member server LDAP is also used
   by the winbindd service when connecting to domain controllers.

   Samba also offers an LDAP server when running as
   active directory domain controller.

   The NTLMSSP authentication used by the SMB1 encryption
   is protected by smb signing, see CVE-2015-5296.

o  CVE-2016-2111:

   It's basically the same as CVE-2015-0005 for Windows:

     The NETLOGON service in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2,
     Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, and Windows Server 2012 Gold
     and R2, when a Domain Controller is configured, allows remote
     attackers to spoof the computer name of a secure channel's
     endpoint, and obtain sensitive session information, by running a
     crafted application and leveraging the ability to sniff network
     traffic, aka "NETLOGON Spoofing Vulnerability".

   The vulnerability in Samba is worse as it doesn't require
   credentials of a computer account in the domain.

   This only applies to Samba running as classic primary domain controller,
   classic backup domain controller or active directory domain controller.

   The security patches introduce a new option called "raw NTLMv2 auth"
   ("yes" or "no") for the [global] section in smb.conf.
   Samba (the smbd process) will reject client using raw NTLMv2
   without using NTLMSSP.

   Note that this option also applies to Samba running as
   standalone server and member server.

   You should also consider using "lanman auth = no" (which is already the default)
   and "ntlm auth = no". Have a look at the smb.conf manpage for further details,
   as they might impact compatibility with older clients. These also
   apply for all server roles.

o  CVE-2016-2112:

   Samba uses various LDAP client libraries, a builtin one and/or the system
   ldap libraries (typically openldap).

   As active directory domain controller Samba also provides an LDAP server.

   Samba takes care of doing SASL (GSS-SPNEGO) authentication with Kerberos or NTLMSSP
   for LDAP connections, including possible integrity (sign) and privacy (seal)
   protection.

   Samba has support for an option called "client ldap sasl wrapping" since version
   3.2.0. Its default value has changed from "plain" to "sign" with version 4.2.0.

   Tools using the builtin LDAP client library do not obey the
   "client ldap sasl wrapping" option. This applies to tools like:
   "samba-tool", "ldbsearch", "ldbedit" and more. Some of them have command line
   options like "--sign" and "--encrypt". With the security update they will
   also obey the "client ldap sasl wrapping" option as default.

   In all cases, even if explicitly request via "client ldap sasl wrapping",
   "--sign" or "--encrypt", the protection can be downgraded by a man in the
   middle.

   The LDAP server doesn't have an option to enforce strong authentication
   yet. The security patches will introduce a new option called
   "ldap server require strong auth", possible values are "no",
   "allow_sasl_over_tls" and "yes".

   As the default behavior was as "no" before, you may
   have to explicitly change this option until all clients have
   been adjusted to handle LDAP_STRONG_AUTH_REQUIRED errors.
   Windows clients and Samba member servers already use
   integrity protection.

o  CVE-2016-2113:

   Samba has support for TLS/SSL for some protocols:
   ldap and http, but currently certificates are not
   validated at all. While we have a "tls cafile" option,
   the configured certificate is not used to validate
   the server certificate.

   This applies to ldaps:// connections triggered by tools like:
   "ldbsearch", "ldbedit" and more. Note that it only applies
   to the ldb tools when they are built as part of Samba or with Samba
   extensions installed, which means the Samba builtin LDAP client library is
   used.

   It also applies to dcerpc client connections using ncacn_http (with https://),
   which are only used by the openchange project. Support for ncacn_http
   was introduced in version 4.2.0.

   The security patches will introduce a new option called
   "tls verify peer". Possible values are "no_check", "ca_only",
   "ca_and_name_if_available", "ca_and_name" and "as_strict_as_possible".

   If you use the self-signed certificates which are auto-generated
   by Samba, you won't have a crl file and need to explicitly
   set "tls verify peer = ca_and_name".

o  CVE-2016-2114

   Due to a regression introduced in Samba 4.0.0,
   an explicit "server signing = mandatory" in the [global] section
   of the smb.conf was not enforced for clients using the SMB1 protocol.

   As a result it does not enforce smb signing and allows man in the middle attacks.

   This problem applies to all possible server roles:
   standalone server, member server, classic primary domain controller,
   classic backup domain controller and active directory domain controller.

   In addition, when Samba is configured with "server role = active directory domain controller"
   the effective default for the "server signing" option should be "mandatory".

   During the early development of Samba 4 we had a new experimental
   file server located under source4/smb_server. But before
   the final 4.0.0 release we switched back to the file server
   under source3/smbd.

   But the logic for the correct default of "server signing" was not
   ported correctly ported.

   Note that the default for server roles other than active directory domain
   controller, is "off" because of performance reasons.

o  CVE-2016-2115:

   Samba has an option called "client signing", this is turned off by default
   for performance reasons on file transfers.

   This option is also used when using DCERPC with ncacn_np.

   In order to get integrity protection for ipc related communication
   by default the "client ipc signing" option is introduced.
   The effective default for this new option is "mandatory".

   In order to be compatible with more SMB server implementations,
   the following additional options are introduced:
   "client ipc min protocol" ("NT1" by default) and
   "client ipc max protocol" (the highest support SMB2/3 dialect by default).
   These options overwrite the "client min protocol" and "client max protocol"
   options, because the default for "client max protocol" is still "NT1".
   The reason for this is the fact that all SMB2/3 support SMB signing,
   while there are still SMB1 implementations which don't offer SMB signing
   by default (this includes Samba versions before 4.0.0).

   Note that winbindd (in versions 4.2.0 and higher) enforces SMB signing
   against active directory domain controllers despite of the
   "client signing" and "client ipc signing" options.

o  CVE-2016-2118 (a.k.a. BADLOCK):

   The Security Account Manager Remote Protocol [MS-SAMR] and the
   Local Security Authority (Domain Policy) Remote Protocol [MS-LSAD]
   are both vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. Both are application level
   protocols based on the generic DCE 1.1 Remote Procedure Call (DCERPC) protocol.

   These protocols are typically available on all Windows installations
   as well as every Samba server. They are used to maintain
   the Security Account Manager Database. This applies to all
   roles, e.g. standalone, domain member, domain controller.

   Any authenticated DCERPC connection a client initiates against a server
   can be used by a man in the middle to impersonate the authenticated user
   against the SAMR or LSAD service on the server.

   The client chosen application protocol, auth type (e.g. Kerberos or NTLMSSP)
   and auth level (NONE, CONNECT, PKT_INTEGRITY, PKT_PRIVACY) do not matter
   in this case. A man in the middle can change auth level to CONNECT
   (which means authentication without message protection) and take over
   the connection.

   As a result, a man in the middle is able to get read/write access to the
   Security Account Manager Database, which reveals all passwords
   and any other potential sensitive information.

   Samba running as an active directory domain controller is additionally
   missing checks to enforce PKT_PRIVACY for the
   Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol [MS-DRSR] (drsuapi)
   and the BackupKey Remote Protocol [MS-BKRP] (backupkey).
   The Domain Name Service Server Management Protocol [MS-DNSP] (dnsserver)
   is not enforcing at least PKT_INTEGRITY.

====================
New smb.conf options
====================

  allow dcerpc auth level connect (G)

    This option controls whether DCERPC services are allowed to be used with
    DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_CONNECT, which provides authentication, but no per
    message integrity nor privacy protection.

    Some interfaces like samr, lsarpc and netlogon have a hard-coded default
    of no and epmapper, mgmt and rpcecho have a hard-coded default of yes.

    The behavior can be overwritten per interface name (e.g. lsarpc,
    netlogon, samr, srvsvc, winreg, wkssvc ...) by using
    'allow dcerpc auth level connect:interface = yes' as option.

    This option yields precedence to the implementation specific restrictions.
    E.g. the drsuapi and backupkey protocols require DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_PRIVACY.
    The dnsserver protocol requires DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_INTEGRITY.

    Default: allow dcerpc auth level connect = no

    Example: allow dcerpc auth level connect = yes

  client ipc signing (G)

    This controls whether the client is allowed or required to use
    SMB signing for IPC$ connections as DCERPC transport. Possible
    values are auto, mandatory and disabled.

    When set to mandatory or default, SMB signing is required.

    When set to auto, SMB signing is offered, but not enforced and
    if set to disabled, SMB signing is not offered either.

    Connections from winbindd to Active Directory Domain Controllers
    always enforce signing.

    Default: client ipc signing = default

  client ipc max protocol (G)

    The value of the parameter (a string) is the highest protocol level that will
    be supported for IPC$ connections as DCERPC transport.

    Normally this option should not be set as the automatic negotiation phase
    in the SMB protocol takes care of choosing the appropriate protocol.

    The value default refers to the latest supported protocol, currently SMB3_11.

    See client max protocol for a full list of available protocols.
    The values CORE, COREPLUS, LANMAN1, LANMAN2 are silently upgraded to NT1.

    Default: client ipc max protocol = default

    Example: client ipc max protocol = SMB2_10

  client ipc min protocol (G)

    This setting controls the minimum protocol version that the will be
    attempted to use for IPC$ connections as DCERPC transport.

    Normally this option should not be set as the automatic negotiation phase
    in the SMB protocol takes care of choosing the appropriate protocol.

    The value default refers to the higher value of NT1 and the
    effective value of "client min protocol".

    See client max protocol for a full list of available protocols.
    The values CORE, COREPLUS, LANMAN1, LANMAN2 are silently upgraded to NT1.

    Default: client ipc min protocol = default

    Example: client ipc min protocol = SMB3_11

  ldap server require strong auth (G)

    The ldap server require strong auth defines whether the
    ldap server requires ldap traffic to be signed or
    signed and encrypted (sealed). Possible values are no,
    allow_sasl_over_tls and yes.

    A value of no allows simple and sasl binds over all transports.

    A value of allow_sasl_over_tls allows simple and sasl binds (without sign or seal)
    over TLS encrypted connections. Unencrypted connections only
    allow sasl binds with sign or seal.

    A value of yes allows only simple binds over TLS encrypted connections.
    Unencrypted connections only allow sasl binds with sign or seal.

    Default: ldap server require strong auth = yes

  raw NTLMv2 auth (G)

    This parameter determines whether or not smbd(8) will allow SMB1 clients
    without extended security (without SPNEGO) to use NTLMv2 authentication.

    If this option, lanman auth and ntlm auth are all disabled, then only
    clients with SPNEGO support will be permitted. That means NTLMv2 is only
    supported within NTLMSSP.

    Default: raw NTLMv2 auth = no

  tls verify peer (G)

    This controls if and how strict the client will verify the peer's
    certificate and name. Possible values are (in increasing order): no_check,
    ca_only, ca_and_name_if_available, ca_and_name and as_strict_as_possible.

    When set to no_check the certificate is not verified at all,
    which allows trivial man in the middle attacks.

    When set to ca_only the certificate is verified to be signed from a ca
    specified in the "tls ca file" option. Setting "tls ca file" to a valid file
    is required. The certificate lifetime is also verified. If the "tls crl file"
    option is configured, the certificate is also verified against
    the ca crl.

    When set to ca_and_name_if_available all checks from ca_only are performed.
    In addition, the peer hostname is verified against the certificate's
    name, if it is provided by the application layer and not given as
    an ip address string.

    When set to ca_and_name all checks from ca_and_name_if_available are performed.
    In addition the peer hostname needs to be provided and even an ip
    address is checked against the certificate's name.

    When set to as_strict_as_possible all checks from ca_and_name are performed.
    In addition the "tls crl file" needs to be configured. Future versions
    of Samba may implement additional checks.

    Default: tls verify peer = as_strict_as_possible

  tls priority (G) (backported from Samba 4.3 to Samba 4.2)

    This option can be set to a string describing the TLS protocols to be
    supported in the parts of Samba that use GnuTLS, specifically the AD DC.

    The default turns off SSLv3, as this protocol is no longer considered
    secure after CVE-2014-3566 (otherwise known as POODLE) impacted SSLv3 use
    in HTTPS applications.

    The valid options are described in the GNUTLS Priority-Strings
    documentation at http://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html

    Default: tls priority = NORMAL:-VERS-SSL3.0

================
Behavior changes
================

o  The default auth level for authenticated binds has changed from
   DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_CONNECT to DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_INTEGRITY.
   That means ncacn_ip_tcp:server is now implicitly the same
   as ncacn_ip_tcp:server[sign] and offers a similar protection
   as ncacn_np:server, which relies on smb signing.

o  The following constraints are applied to SMB1 connections:

   - "client lanman auth = yes" is now consistently
     required for authenticated connections using the
     SMB1 LANMAN2 dialect.
   - "client ntlmv2 auth = yes" and "client use spnego = yes"
     (both the default values), require extended security (SPNEGO)
     support from the server. That means NTLMv2 is only used within
     NTLMSSP.

o  Tools like "samba-tool", "ldbsearch", "ldbedit" and more obey the
   default of "client ldap sasl wrapping = sign". Even with
   "client ldap sasl wrapping = plain" they will automatically upgrade
   to "sign" when getting LDAP_STRONG_AUTH_REQUIRED from the LDAP
   server.

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.2.9
                           March 8, 2016
                   =============================


This is a security release in order to address the following CVEs:

o  CVE-2015-7560 (Incorrect ACL get/set allowed on symlink path)
o  CVE-2016-0771 (Out-of-bounds read in internal DNS server)

=======
Details
=======

o  CVE-2015-7560:
   All versions of Samba from 3.2.0 to 4.4.0rc3 inclusive are vulnerable to
   a malicious client overwriting the ownership of ACLs using symlinks.

   An authenticated malicious client can use SMB1 UNIX extensions to
   create a symlink to a file or directory, and then use non-UNIX SMB1
   calls to overwrite the contents of the ACL on the file or directory
   linked to.

o  CVE-2016-0771:
   All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 to 4.4.0rc3 inclusive, when deployed as
   an AD DC and choose to run the internal DNS server, are vulnerable to an
   out-of-bounds read issue during DNS TXT record handling caused by users
   with permission to modify DNS records.

   A malicious client can upload a specially constructed DNS TXT record,
   resulting in a remote denial-of-service attack. As long as the affected
   TXT record remains undisturbed in the Samba database, a targeted DNS
   query may continue to trigger this exploit.

   While unlikely, the out-of-bounds read may bypass safety checks and
   allow leakage of memory from the server in the form of a DNS TXT reply.

   By default only authenticated accounts can upload DNS records,
   as "allow dns updates = secure only" is the default.
   Any other value would allow anonymous clients to trigger this
   bug, which is a much higher risk.

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.2.7
                         December 16, 2015
                   =============================


This is a security release in order to address the following CVEs:

o  CVE-2015-3223 (Denial of service in Samba Active Directory
		  server)
o  CVE-2015-5252 (Insufficient symlink verification in smbd)
o  CVE-2015-5299 (Missing access control check in shadow copy
		  code)
o  CVE-2015-5296 (Samba client requesting encryption vulnerable
		  to downgrade attack)
o  CVE-2015-8467 (Denial of service attack against Windows
		  Active Directory server)
o  CVE-2015-5330 (Remote memory read in Samba LDAP server)

Please note that if building against a system libldb, the required
version has been bumped to ldb-1.1.24.  This is needed to ensure
we build against a system ldb library that contains the fixes
for CVE-2015-5330 and CVE-2015-3223.

=======
Details
=======

o  CVE-2015-3223:
   All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive (resp. all
   ldb versions up to 1.1.23 inclusive) are vulnerable to
   a denial of service attack in the samba daemon LDAP server.

   A malicious client can send packets that cause the LDAP server in the
   samba daemon process to become unresponsive, preventing the server
   from servicing any other requests.

   This flaw is not exploitable beyond causing the code to loop expending
   CPU resources.

o  CVE-2015-5252:
   All versions of Samba from 3.0.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive are vulnerable to
   a bug in symlink verification, which under certain circumstances could
   allow client access to files outside the exported share path.

   If a Samba share is configured with a path that shares a common path
   prefix with another directory on the file system, the smbd daemon may
   allow the client to follow a symlink pointing to a file or directory
   in that other directory, even if the share parameter "wide links" is
   set to "no" (the default).

o  CVE-2015-5299:
   All versions of Samba from 3.2.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive are vulnerable to
   a missing access control check in the vfs_shadow_copy2 module. When
   looking for the shadow copy directory under the share path the current
   accessing user should have DIRECTORY_LIST access rights in order to
   view the current snapshots.

   This was not being checked in the affected versions of Samba.

o  CVE-2015-5296:
   Versions of Samba from 3.2.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive do not ensure that
   signing is negotiated when creating an encrypted client connection to
   a server.

   Without this a man-in-the-middle attack could downgrade the connection
   and connect using the supplied credentials as an unsigned, unencrypted
   connection.

o  CVE-2015-8467:
   Samba, operating as an AD DC, is sometimes operated in a domain with a
   mix of Samba and Windows Active Directory Domain Controllers.

   All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive, when deployed as
   an AD DC in the same domain with Windows DCs, could be used to
   override the protection against the MS15-096 / CVE-2015-2535 security
   issue in Windows.

   Prior to MS16-096 it was possible to bypass the quota of machine
   accounts a non-administrative user could create.  Pure Samba domains
   are not impacted, as Samba does not implement the
   SeMachineAccountPrivilege functionality to allow non-administrator
   users to create new computer objects.

o  CVE-2015-5330:
   All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive (resp. all
   ldb versions up to 1.1.23 inclusive) are vulnerable to
   a remote memory read attack in the samba daemon LDAP server.

   A malicious client can send packets that cause the LDAP server in the
   samba daemon process to return heap memory beyond the length of the
   requested value.

   This memory may contain data that the client should not be allowed to
   see, allowing compromise of the server.

   The memory may either be returned to the client in an error string, or
   stored in the database by a suitabily privileged user.  If untrusted
   users can create objects in your database, please confirm that all DN
   and name attributes are reasonable.


Changes since 4.2.6:
--------------------

o  Andrew Bartlett <abartlet@samba.org>
   * BUG 11552: CVE-2015-8467: samdb: Match MS15-096 behaviour for
     userAccountControl.

     access outside the share).
   * BUG 11529: CVE-2015-5299: s3-shadow-copy2: Fix missing access check on
     snapdir.

o  Douglas Bagnall <douglas.bagnall@catalyst.net.nz>
   * BUG 11599: CVE-2015-5330: Fix remote read memory exploit in LDB.

o  Stefan Metzmacher <metze@samba.org>

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.2.0
                           March 04, 2015
                   =============================


This is is the first stable release of Samba 4.2.

Samba 4.2 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


Samba User Survey 2015
======================

https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2020369/Samba-User-Survey-2015

Please take our survey. It will help us improve Samba by understanding
your knowledge and needs. The survey runs until end of March 2015 and
won't ask for any personal info. The full results will be shared with
the Samba Team, and statistical summaries will be shared with the
Samba community after the SambaXP conference (http://sambaxp.org).


IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE SUPPORT END OF SAMBA 3
=================================================

With the final release of Samba 4.2, the last series of Samba 3 has
been discontinued! People still running 3.6.x or earlier,should
consider moving to a more recent and maintained version (4.0 - 4.2).
One of the common misconceptions is that Samba 4.x automatically
means "Active Directory only": This is wrong!

Acting as an Active Directory Domain Controller is just one of the
enhancements included in Samba 4.0 and later. Version 4.0 was just the
next release after the 3.6 series and contains all the features of the
previous ones - including the NT4-style (classic) domain support. This
means you can update a Samba 3.x NT4-style PDC to 4.x, just as you've
updated in the past (e.g. from 3.4.x to 3.5.x). You don't have to move
your NT4-style domain to an Active Directory!

And of course the possibility remains unchanged, to setup a new NT4-style
PDC with Samba 4.x, like done in the past (e.g. with openLDAP backend).
Active Directory support in Samba 4 is additional and does not replace
any of these features. We do understand the difficulty presented by
existing LDAP structures and for that reason there isn't a plan to
decommission the classic PDC support. It remains tested by the continuous
integration system.

The code that supports the classic Domain Controller is also the same
code that supports the internal 'Domain' of standalone servers and
Domain Member Servers. This means that we still use this code, even
when not acting as an AD Domain Controller. It is also the basis for
some of the features of FreeIPA and so it gets development attention
from that direction as well.


UPGRADING
=========

Read the "Winbindd/Netlogon improvements" section (below) carefully!


NEW FEATURES
============

Transparent File Compression
============================

Samba 4.2.0 adds support for the manipulation of file and folder
compression flags on the Btrfs filesystem.
With the Btrfs Samba VFS module enabled, SMB2+ compression flags can
be set remotely from the Windows Explorer File->Properties->Advanced
dialog. Files flagged for compression are transparently compressed
and uncompressed when accessed or modified.

Previous File Versions with Snapper
===================================

The newly added Snapper VFS module exposes snapshots managed by
Snapper for use by Samba. This provides the ability for remote
clients to access shadow-copies via Windows Explorer using the
"previous versions" dialog.

Winbindd/Netlogon improvements
==============================

The whole concept of maintaining the netlogon secure channel
to (other) domain controllers was rewritten in order to maintain
global state in a netlogon_creds_cli.tdb. This is the proper fix
for a large number of bugs:

  https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6563
  https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7944
  https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7945
  https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7568
  https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8599

In addition a strong session key is now required by default,
which means that communication to older servers or clients
might be rejected by default.

For the client side we have the following new options:
"require strong key" (yes by default), "reject md5 servers" (no by default).
E.g. for Samba 3.0.37 you need "require strong key = no" and
for NT4 DCs you need "require strong key = no" and "client NTLMv2 auth = no",

On the server side (as domain controller) we have the following new options:
"allow nt4 crypto" (no by default), "reject md5 client" (no by default).
E.g. in order to allow Samba < 3.0.27 or NT4 members to work
you need "allow nt4 crypto = yes"

winbindd does not list group memberships for display purposes
(e.g. getent group <domain\<group>) anymore by default.
The new default is "winbind expand groups = 0" now,
the reason for this is the same as for "winbind enum users = no"
and "winbind enum groups = no". Providing this information is not always
reliably possible, e.g. if there are trusted domains.

Please consult the smb.conf manpage for more details on these new options.

Winbindd use on the Samba AD DC
===============================

Winbindd is now used on the Samba AD DC by default, replacing the
partial rewrite used for winbind operations in Samba 4.0 and 4.1.

This allows more code to be shared, more options to be honoured, and
paves the way for support for trusted domains in the AD DC.

If required the old internal winbind can be activated by setting
'server services = +winbind -winbindd'.  Upgrading users with a server
services parameter specified should ensure they change 'winbind' to
'winbindd' to obtain the new functionality.

The 'samba' binary still manages the starting of this service, there
is no need to start the winbindd binary manually.

Winbind now requires secured connections
========================================

To improve protection against rogue domain controllers we now require
that when we connect to an AD DC in our forest, that the connection be
signed using SMB Signing.  Set 'client signing = off' in the smb.conf
to disable.

Also and DCE/RPC pipes must be sealed, set 'require strong key =
false' and 'winbind sealed pipes = false' to disable.

Finally, the default for 'client ldap sasl wrapping' has been set to
'sign', to ensure the integrity of LDAP connections.  Set 'client ldap
sasl wrapping = plain' to disable.

Larger IO sizes for SMB2/3 by default
=====================================

The default values for "smb2 max read", "smb2 max write" and "smb2 max trans"
have been changed to 8388608 (8MiB) in order to match the default of
Windows 2012R2.

SMB2 leases
===========

The SMB2 protocol allows clients to aggressively cache files
locally above and beyond the caching allowed by SMB1 and SMB2 oplocks.

Called SMB2 leases, this can greatly reduce traffic on an SMB2
connection. Samba 4.2 now implements SMB2 leases.

It can be turned on by setting the parameter "smb2 leases = yes"
in the [global] section of your smb.conf. This parameter is set
to off by default until the SMB2 leasing code is declared fully stable.

Improved DCERPC man in the middle detection
===========================================

The DCERPC header signing has been implemented
in addition to the dcerpc_sec_verification_trailer
protection.

Overhauled "net idmap" command
==============================

The command line interface of the "net idmap" command has been
made systematic, and subcommands for reading and writing the autorid idmap
database have been added. Note that the writing commands should be
used with great care. See the net(8) manual page for details.

tdb improvements
================

The tdb library, our core mechanism to store Samba-specific data on disk and
share it between processes, has been improved to support process shared robust
mutexes on Linux. These mutexes are available on Linux and Solaris and
significantly reduce the overhead involved with tdb. To enable mutexes for
tdb, set

dbwrap_tdb_mutexes:* = yes

in the [global] section of your smb.conf.

Tdb file space management has also been made more efficient. This
will lead to smaller and less fragmented databases.

Messaging improvements
======================

Our internal messaging subsystem, used for example for things like oplock
break messages between smbds or setting a process debug level dynamically, has
been rewritten to use unix domain datagram messages.

Clustering support
==================

Samba's file server clustering component CTDB is now integrated in the
Samba tree.  This avoids the confusion of compatibility of Samba and CTDB
versions as existed previously.

To build the Samba file server with cluster support, use the configure
command line option --with-cluster-support.  This will build clustered
file server against the in-tree CTDB and will also build CTDB.
Building clustered samba with previous versions of CTDB is no longer
supported.

Samba Registry Editor
=====================

The utitlity to browse the samba registry has been overhauled by our Google
Summer of Code student Chris Davis. Now samba-regedit has a
Midnight-Commander-like theme and UI experience. You can browse keys and edit
the diffent value types. For a data value type a hexeditor has been
implemented.

Bad Password Lockout in the AD DC
=================================

Samba's AD DC now implements bad password lockout (on a per-DC basis).

That is, incorrect password attempts are tracked, and accounts locked
out if too many bad passwords are submitted.  There is also a grace
period of 60 minutes on the previous password when used for NTLM
authentication (matching Windows 2003 SP1: https://support2.microsoft.com/kb/906305).

The relevant settings can be seen using 'samba-tool domain
passwordsettings show' (the new settings being highlighted):

Password informations for domain 'DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com'

Password complexity: on
Store plaintext passwords: off
Password history length: 24
Minimum password length: 7
Minimum password age (days): 1
Maximum password age (days): 42
* Account lockout duration (mins): 30     *
* Account lockout threshold (attempts): 0 *
* Reset account lockout after (mins): 30  *

These values can be set using 'samba-tool domain passwordsettings set'.

Correct defaults in the smb.conf manpages
=========================================

The default values for smb.conf parameters are now correctly specified
in the smb.conf manpage, even when they refer to build-time specified
paths.  Provided Samba is built on a system with the right tools
(xsltproc in particular) required to generate our man pages, then
these will be built with the exact same embedded paths as used by the
configuration parser at runtime.  Additionally, the default values
read from the smb.conf manpage are checked by our test suite to match
the values seen in testparm and used by the running binaries.

Consistent behaviour between samba-tool testparm and testparm
=============================================================

With the exception of the registry backend, which remains only
available in the file server, the behaviour of the smb.conf parser and
the tools 'samba-tool testparm' and 'testparm' is now consistent,
particularly with regard to default values.  Except with regard to
registry shares, it is no longer needed to use one tool on the AD
DC, and another on the file server.

VFS WORM module
===============

A VFS module for basic WORM (Write once read many) support has been
added. It allows an additional layer on top of a Samba share, that provides
a basic set of WORM functionality on the client side, to control the
writeability of files and folders.

As the module is simply an additional layer, share access and permissions
work like expected - only WORM functionality is added on top. Removing the
module from the share configuration, removes this layer again. The
filesystem ACLs are not affected in any way from the module and treated
as usual.

The module does not provide complete WORM functions, like some archiving
products do! It is not audit-proof, because the WORM function is only
available on the client side, when accessing a share through SMB! If
the same folder is shared by other services like NFS, the access only
depends on the underlying filesystem ACLs. Equally if you access the
content directly on the server.

For additional information, see
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/VFS/vfs_worm

vfs_fruit, a VFS module for OS X clients
========================================

A new VFS module that provides enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB
clients and interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver.

The module features enhanced performance with reliable named streams
support, interoperability with special characters commonly used by OS
X client (eg '*', '/'), integrated file locking and Mac metadata
access with Netatalk 3 and enhanced performance by implementing
Apple's SMB2 extension codenamed "AAPL".

The modules behaviour is fully configurable, please refer to the
manpage vfs_fruit for further details.

smbclient archival improvements
===============================

Archive creation and extraction support in smbclient has been rewritten
to use libarchive. This fixes a number of outstanding bugs in Samba's
previous custom tar implementation and also adds support for the
extraction of zipped archives.
smbclient archive support can be enabled or disabled at build time with
corresponding --with[out]-libarchive configure parameters.
