UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

GPO Improvements
----------------

A new 'samba-tool gpo export' command has been added that can export a
set of Group Policy Objects from a domain in a generalised XML format.

A corresponding 'samba-tool gpo restore' command has been added to
rebuild the Group Policy Objects from the XML after generalization.
(The administrator needs to correct the values of XML entities between
the backup and restore to account for the change in domain).

kdc prefork
-----------

The KDC now supports the pre-fork process model and worker processes will be
forked for the KDC when the pre-fork process model is selected for samba.

prefork 'prefork children'
--------------------------

The default value for this smdb.conf parameter has been increased from 1 to
4.

netlogon prefork
----------------

DCERPC now supports pre-forked NETLOGON processes. The netlogon processes are
pre-forked when the prefork process model is selected for samba.
