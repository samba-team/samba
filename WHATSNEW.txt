                   Release Notes for Samba 3.2.0pre2
                               Oct XX, 2007
                   =================================

This is the second preview release of Samba 3.2.0.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Please be aware that Samba is now distributed under the version 3
of the new GNU General Public License.  You may refer to the COPYING
file that accompanies these release notes for further licensing details.

Major enhancements in Samba 3.2.0 include:

  File Serving:
  o Use of IDL generated parsing layer for several DCE/RPC
    interfaces.
  o Removal of the 1024 byte limit on pathnames and 256 byte limit on
    filename components to honor the MAX_PATH setting from the host OS.
  o Introduction of a registry based configuration system.
  o Improved CIFS Unix Extensions support.
  o Experimental support for file serving clusters.
  o Support for storing alternate data streams in xattrs


  Winbind and Active Directory Integration:
  o Full support for Windows 2003 cross-forest, transitive trusts
    and one-way domain trusts
  o Support for userPrincipalName logons via pam_winbind and NSS
    lookups.
  o Support in pam_winbind for logging on using the userPrincipalName.
  o Expansion of nested domain groups via NSS calls.
  o Support for Active Directory LDAP Signing policy.


  Users & Groups:
  o New ldb backend for local group mapping tables
  o Raised level of security defaults for authentication operations.


  Documentation:
  o Inclusion of an HTLM version of the 3rd edition of "Using Samba"
    from O'Reilly Publishing.


Now Licensed under the GNU GPLv3
================================

The Samba Team has adopted the Version 3 of the GNU General Public
License for the 3.2 and later releases.   The GPLv3 is the updated
version of the GPLv2 license under which Samba is currently
distributed. It has been updated to improve compatibility with other
licenses and to make it easier to adopt internationally, and is an 
improved version of the license to better suit the needs of Free
Software in the 21st Century.

The original announcement is available on-line at 

    http://news.samba.org/announcements/samba_gplv3/


New Security Defaults for Authentication
========================================

Support for LanMan passwords is now disabled in both client and server 
applications.  Additionally, clear text authentication requests are 
disabled by default in client utilities such as smbclient and all
libsmbclient based applications.  This will affect connection both 
to and from hosts running DOS, Windows 9x/ME, and OS/2.  Please refer 
to the "Changes" section for details on the exact parameters that were 
updated.



Registry Configuration Backend
==============================

Samba is now able to use a registry based configuration backed to
supplement smb.conf setting.  This feature may be enabled by setting
"include = registry" and "registry shares = yes" in the [global] 
section of smb.conf and may be managed using the "net conf" command.  

More information may be obtained from the smb.conf(5) and net(8) man 
pages.


Removed Features
================

Both the Python bindings and the libmsrpc shared library have been
removed from the tree due to lack of an official maintainer.
