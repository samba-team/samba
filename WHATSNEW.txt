                   =================================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.5.0pre1

                   =================================

This is the first preview release of Samba 3.5.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Major enhancements in Samba 3.5.0 include:

General changes:
o Add support for full Windows timestamp resolution

Protocol changes:
o Experimental implementation of SMB2

Printing Changes:
o Add encryption support for connections to a CUPS server

Winbind changes:
o Major refactoring
o Asynchronous

General changes:
================

Support for full Windows timestamp resolution has been added. This effectively
makes us use Windows' full 100ns timestamp resolution if supported by the
kernel (2.6.22 and higher) and the glibc (2.6 and higher).

Protocol changes
================

An EXPERIMENTAL implementation of the SMB2 protocol has been added. SMB2 can be
enabled by setting "max protocol = smb2". SMB2 is a new implementation of the
SMB protocol used by Windows Vista and higher.

Printing Changes
================

A new parameter "cups encrypt" has been added to control whether connections to
CUPS servers will be encrypted or not. The default is to use unencrypted
connections.

Winbind changes
===============

The Winbind daemon has been refactored internally to be asynchronous. The new
Winbind will not be blocked by running 'wbinfo -g' or 'wbinfo -u'.
