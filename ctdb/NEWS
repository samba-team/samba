Changes in CTDB 2.3
===================

User-visible changes
--------------------

* 2 new configuration variables for 60.nfs eventscript:

  - CTDB_MONITOR_NFS_THREAD_COUNT
  - CTDB_NFS_DUMP_STUCK_THREADS

  See ctdb.sysconfig for details.

Important bug fixes
-------------------

* ctdb tool should not exit from a retry loop if a control times out
  (e.g. under high load).  This simple fix will stop an exit from the
  retry loop on any error.

* When updating flags on all nodes, use the correct updated flags.  This
  should avoid wrong flag change messages in the logs.

* The recovery daemon will not ban other nodes if the current node
  is banned.

Important internal changes
--------------------------

* The recovery daemon on stopped or banned node will stop participating in any
  cluster activity.


Changes in CTDB 2.2
===================

User-visible changes
--------------------

* The "stopped" event has been removed.

  The "ipreallocated" event is now run when a node is stopped.  Use
  this instead of "stopped".

* New --pidfile option for ctdbd, used by initscript

* The 60.nfs eventscript now uses configuration files in
  /etc/ctdb/nfs-rpc-checks.d/ for timeouts and actions instead of
  hardcoding them into the script.

* Notification handler scripts can now be dropped into /etc/ctdb/notify.d/.

* The NoIPTakeoverOnDisabled tunable has been renamed to
  NoIPHostOnAllDisabled and now works properly when set on individual
  nodes.

* New ctdb subcommand "runstate" prints the current internal runstate.
  Runstates are used for serialising startup.

Important bug fixes
-------------------

* The Unix domain socket is now set to non-blocking after the
  connection succeeds.  This avoids connections failing with EAGAIN
  and not being retried.

* Fetching from the log ringbuffer now succeeds if the buffer is full.

* Fix a severe recovery bug that can lead to data corruption for SMB clients.

* The statd-callout script now runs as root via sudo.

* "ctdb delip" no longer fails if it is unable to move the IP.

* A race in the ctdb tool's ipreallocate code was fixed.  This fixes
  potential bugs in the "disable", "enable", "stop", "continue",
  "ban", "unban", "ipreallocate" and "sync" commands.

* The monitor cancellation code could sometimes hang indefinitely.
  This could cause "ctdb stop" and "ctdb shutdown" to fail.

Important internal changes
--------------------------

* The socket I/O handling has been optimised to improve performance.

* IPs will not be assigned to nodes during CTDB initialisation.  They
  will only be assigned to nodes that are in the "running" runstate.

* Improved database locking code.  One improvement is to use a
  standalone locking helper executable - the avoids creating many
  forked copies of ctdbd and potentially running a node out of memory.

* New control CTDB_CONTROL_IPREALLOCATED is now used to generate
  "ipreallocated" events.

* Message handlers are now indexed, providing a significant
  performance improvement.
