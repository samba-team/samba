This directory contains run-time support scripts for CTDB.

Selected highlights:

  ctdb.init

    An initscript for starting ctdbd at boot time.

  events/

    Eventscripts.  See events/README for more details.

  functions

    Support functions, sourced by eventscripts and other scripts.

  statd-callout

    rpc.statd high-availability callout to support lock migration on
    failover.

Notes:

* All of these scripts are written in POSIX Bourne shell.  Please
  avoid bash-isms, including the use of "local" variables (which are
  not available in POSIX shell).

* Do not use absolute paths for commands.  Unit tests attempt to
  replace many commands with stubs and can not do this if commands are
  specified with absolute paths.  The functions file controls $PATH so
  absolute paths should not be required.
