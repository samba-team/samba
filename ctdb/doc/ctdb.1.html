      ctdb is a utility to view and manage a ctdb cluster.
    </p></div><div class="refsect1" title="OPTIONS"><a name="idp200792"></a><h2>OPTIONS</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">-n &lt;pnn&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>
            This specifies the physical node number on which to execute the 
	    command. Default is to run the command on the daemon running on 
	    the local host.
	  </p><p>
	    The physical node number is an integer that describes the node in the
	    cluster. The first node has physical node number 0.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-Y</span></dt><dd><p>
            Produce output in machine readable form for easier parsing by scripts. Not all commands support this option.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-t &lt;timeout&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>
            How long should ctdb wait for the local ctdb daemon to respond to a command before timing out. Default is 3 seconds.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-T &lt;timelimit&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>
            A limit on how long the ctdb command will run for before it will
	    be aborted. When this timelimit has been exceeded the ctdb command will
	    terminate.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-? --help</span></dt><dd><p>
            Print some help text to the screen.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">--usage</span></dt><dd><p>
            Print useage information to the screen.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-d --debug=&lt;debuglevel&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>
            Change the debug level for the command. Default is 0.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">--socket=&lt;filename&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>
            Specify the socketname to use when connecting to the local ctdb 
            daemon. The default is /tmp/ctdb.socket .
          </p><p>
            You only need to specify this parameter if you run multiple ctdb 
            daemons on the same physical host and thus can not use the default
            name for the domain socket.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">--print-emptyrecords</span></dt><dd><p>
            This enables printing of empty records when dumping databases
            with the catdb, cattbd and dumpdbbackup commands. Records with
            empty data segment are considered deleted by ctdb and cleaned
            by the vacuuming mechanism, so this switch can come in handy for
            debugging the vacuuming behaviour.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">--print-datasize</span></dt><dd><p>
            This lets database dumps (catdb, cattdb, dumpdbbackup) print the
            size of the record data instead of dumping the data contents.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">--print-lmaster</span></dt><dd><p>
            This lets catdb print the lmaster for each record.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">--print-hash</span></dt><dd><p>
            This lets database dumps (catdb, cattdb, dumpdbbackup) print the

          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">--print-recordflags</span></dt><dd><p>
            This lets catdb and dumpdbbackup print the
            record flags for each record. Note that cattdb always
            prints the flags.
          </p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="refsect1" title="Administrative Commands"><a name="idp70096"></a><h2>Administrative Commands</h2><p>
      These are commands used to monitor and administrate a CTDB cluster.
    </p><div class="refsect2" title="pnn"><a name="idp70632"></a><h3>pnn</h3><p>
        This command displays the pnn of the current node.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="status"><a name="idp71216"></a><h3>status</h3><p>
        This command shows the current status of the ctdb node.
      </p><div class="refsect3" title="node status"><a name="idp71760"></a><h4>node status</h4><p>
          Node status reflects the current status of the node. There are five possible states:
        </p><p>
          OK - This node is fully functional.
        </p><p>
          DISCONNECTED - This node could not be connected through the network and is currently not participating in the cluster. If there is a public IP address associated with this node it should have been taken over by a different node. No services are running on this node.
        </p><p>
          DISABLED - This node has been administratively disabled. This node is still functional and participates in the CTDB cluster but its IP addresses have been taken over by a different node and no services are currently being hosted.
        </p><p>
          UNHEALTHY - A service provided by this node is malfunctioning and should be investigated. The CTDB daemon itself is operational and participates in the cluster. Its public IP address has been taken over by a different node and no services are currnetly being hosted. All unhealthy nodes should be investigated and require an administrative action to rectify.
        </p><p>
          BANNED - This node failed too many recovery attempts and has been banned from participating in the cluster for a period of RecoveryBanPeriod seconds. Any public IP address has been taken over by other nodes. This node does not provide any services. All banned nodes should be investigated and require an administrative action to rectify. This node does not perticipate in the CTDB cluster but can still be communicated with. I.e. ctdb commands can be sent to it.
        </p><p>
      STOPPED - A node that is stopped does not host any public ip addresses,
      nor is it part of the VNNMAP. A stopped node can not become LVSMASTER,
      RECMASTER or NATGW.
      This node does not perticipate in the CTDB cluster but can still be
      communicated with. I.e. ctdb commands can be sent to it.
        </p><p>
	PARTIALLYONLINE - A node that is partially online participates
	in a cluster like a node that is ok. Some interfaces to serve
	public ip addresses are down, but at least one interface is up.
	See also "ctdb ifaces".
        </p></div><div class="refsect3" title="generation"><a name="idp75800"></a><h4>generation</h4><p>
          The generation id is a number that indicates the current generation 
          of a cluster instance. Each time a cluster goes through a 
          reconfiguration or a recovery its generation id will be changed.
	  </p><p>
	  This number does not have any particular meaning other than to keep
	  track of when a cluster has gone through a recovery. It is a random
	  number that represents the current instance of a ctdb cluster
	  and its databases.
	  CTDBD uses this number internally to be able to tell when commands 
	  to operate on the cluster and the databases was issued in a different
	  generation of the cluster, to ensure that commands that operate
	  on the databases will not survive across a cluster database recovery.
	  After a recovery, all old outstanding commands will automatically
	  become invalid. 
        </p><p>
	  Sometimes this number will be shown as "INVALID". This only means that
	  the ctdbd daemon has started but it has not yet merged with the cluster through a recovery.
	  All nodes start with generation "INVALID" and are not assigned a real
	  generation id until they have successfully been merged with a cluster
	  through a recovery.
        </p></div><div class="refsect3" title="VNNMAP"><a name="idp77912"></a><h4>VNNMAP</h4><p>
          The list of Virtual Node Numbers. This is a list of all nodes that actively participates in the cluster and that share the workload of hosting the Clustered TDB database records.
          Only nodes that are participating in the vnnmap can become lmaster or dmaster for a database record.
        </p></div><div class="refsect3" title="Recovery mode"><a name="idp78760"></a><h4>Recovery mode</h4><p>
          This is the current recovery mode of the cluster. There are two possible modes:
        </p><p>
          NORMAL - The cluster is fully operational.
        </p><p>
          RECOVERY - The cluster databases have all been frozen, pausing all services while the cluster awaits a recovery process to complete. A recovery process should finish within seconds. If a cluster is stuck in the RECOVERY state this would indicate a cluster malfunction which needs to be investigated.
        </p><p>
	Once the recovery master detects an inconsistency, for example a node 
	becomes disconnected/connected, the recovery daemon will trigger a 
	cluster recovery process, where all databases are remerged across the
	cluster. When this process starts, the recovery master will first
	"freeze" all databases to prevent applications such as samba from 
	accessing the databases and it will also mark the recovery mode as
	RECOVERY.
	</p><p>
	When CTDBD starts up, it will start in RECOVERY mode.
	Once the node has been merged into a cluster and all databases
	have been recovered, the node mode will change into NORMAL mode
	and the databases will be "thawed", allowing samba to access the
	databases again.
	</p></div><div class="refsect3" title="Recovery master"><a name="idp81288"></a><h4>Recovery master</h4><p>
          This is the cluster node that is currently designated as the recovery master. This node is responsible of monitoring the consistency of the cluster and to perform the actual recovery process when reqired.
        </p><p>
	Only one node at a time can be the designated recovery master. Which
	node is designated the recovery master is decided by an election
	process in the recovery daemons running on each node.

      This command shows which node is currently the LVSMASTER. The
      LVSMASTER is the node in the cluster which drives the LVS system and
      which receives all incoming traffic from clients.
      </p><p>
      LVS is the mode where the entire CTDB/Samba cluster uses a single
      ip address for the entire cluster. In this mode all clients connect to
      one specific node which will then multiplex/loadbalance the clients
      evenly onto the other nodes in the cluster. This is an alternative to using

      This command shows which nodes in the cluster are currently active in the
      LVS configuration. I.e. which nodes we are currently loadbalancing
      the single ip address across.
      </p><p>
      LVS will by default only loadbalance across those nodes that are both
      LVS capable and also HEALTHY. Except if all nodes are UNHEALTHY in which
      case LVS will loadbalance across all UNHEALTHY nodes as well.
      LVS will never use nodes that are DISCONNECTED, STOPPED, BANNED or
      DISABLED.

      This command shows the capabilities of the current node.
      Please see manpage for ctdbd for a full list of all capabilities and
      more detailed description.
      </p><p>
      RECMASTER and LMASTER capabilities are primarily used when CTDBD
      is used to create a cluster spanning across WAN links. In which case
      ctdbd acts as a WAN accelerator.
      </p><p>
      LVS capabile means that the node is participating in LVS, a mode
      where the entire CTDB cluster uses one single ip address for the
      entire cluster instead of using public ip address failover.
      This is an alternative to using a loadbalancing layer-4 switch.
      </p><p>
	Example output:
      </p><pre class="screen">
RECMASTER: YES

      </pre></div><div class="refsect2" title="setreclock [filename]"><a name="idp117264"></a><h3>setreclock [filename]</h3><p>
	This command is used to modify, or clear, the file that is used as the reclock file at runtime. When this command is used, the reclock file checks are disabled. To re-enable the checks the administrator needs to activate the "VerifyRecoveryLock" tunable using "ctdb setvar".
      </p><p>
	If run with no parameter this will remove the reclock file completely. If run with a parameter the parameter specifies the new filename to use for the recovery lock.
      </p><p>
	This command only affects the runtime settings of a ctdb node and will be lost when ctdb is restarted. For persistent changes to the reclock file setting you must edit /etc/sysconfig/ctdb.

        This command is used to administratively disable a node in the cluster.
        A disabled node will still participate in the cluster and host
        clustered TDB records but its public ip address has been taken over by
        a different node and it no longer hosts any services.

        This command is used to administratively STOP a node in the cluster.
        A STOPPED node is connected to the cluster but will not host any
	public ip addresse, nor does it participate in the VNNMAP.
	The difference between a DISABLED node and a STOPPED node is that
	a STOPPED node does not host any parts of the database which means
	that a recovery is required to stop/continue nodes.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="continue"><a name="idp124312"></a><h3>continue</h3><p>

	This command is used to add a new public ip to a node during runtime.
	This allows public addresses to be added to a cluster without having
	to restart the ctdb daemons.
      </p><p>
	Note that this only updates the runtime instance of ctdb. Any changes will be lost next time ctdb is restarted and the public addresses file is re-read.
 If you want this change to be permanent you must also update the public addresses file manually.

	This command is used to remove a public ip from a node during runtime.
	If this public ip is currently hosted by the node it being removed from, the ip will first be failed over to another node, if possible, before it is removed.
      </p><p>
	Note that this only updates the runtime instance of ctdb. Any changes will be lost next time ctdb is restarted and the public addresses file is re-read.

      </p><p>
      In order to manually override the "automatic" distribution of public 
      ip addresses that ctdb normally provides, this command only works
      when you have changed the tunables for the daemon to:

        This command will force the recovery master to perform a full ip reallocation process and redistribute all ip addresses. This is useful to "reset" the allocations back to its default state if they have been changed using the "moveip" command. While a "recover" will also perform this reallocation, a recovery is much more hevyweight since it will also rebuild all the databases.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="setlmasterrole &lt;on|off&gt;"><a name="idp131128"></a><h3>setlmasterrole &lt;on|off&gt;</h3><p>
	This command is used ot enable/disable the LMASTER capability for a node at runtime. This capability determines whether or not a node can be used as an LMASTER for records in the database. A node that does not have the LMASTER capability will not show up in the vnnmap.
      </p><p>
	Nodes will by default have this capability, but it can be stripped off nodes by the setting in the sysconfig file or by using this command.
      </p><p>
	Once this setting has been enabled/disabled, you need to perform a recovery for it to take effect.

      This command is used when adding new nodes, or removing existing nodes from an existing cluster.
      </p><p>
      Procedure to add a node:
      </p><p>
      1, To expand an existing cluster, first ensure with 'ctdb status' that
      all nodes are up and running and that they are all healthy.
      Do not try to expand a cluster unless it is completely healthy!
      </p><p>
      2, On all nodes, edit /etc/ctdb/nodes and add the new node as the last
      entry to the file. The new node MUST be added to the end of this file!
      </p><p>
      3, Verify that all the nodes have identical /etc/ctdb/nodes files after you edited them and added the new node!
      </p><p>
      4, Run 'ctdb reloadnodes' to force all nodes to reload the nodesfile.
      </p><p>
      5, Use 'ctdb status' on all nodes and verify that they now show the additional node.
      </p><p>
      6, Install and configure the new node and bring it online.
      </p><p>
      Procedure to remove a node:
      </p><p>
      1, To remove a node from an existing cluster, first ensure with 'ctdb status' that
      all nodes, except the node to be deleted, are up and running and that they are all healthy.
      Do not try to remove a node from a cluster unless the cluster is completely healthy!
      </p><p>
      2, Shutdown and poweroff the node to be removed.
      </p><p>
      3, On all other nodes, edit the /etc/ctdb/nodes file and comment out the node to be removed. Do not delete the line for that node, just comment it out by adding a '#' at the beginning of the line.
      </p><p>
      4, Run 'ctdb reloadnodes' to force all nodes to reload the nodesfile.
      </p><p>
      5, Use 'ctdb status' on all nodes and verify that the deleted node no longer shows up in the list..
      </p><p>
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="reloadips"><a name="idp141008"></a><h3>reloadips</h3><p>
      This command is used to reload the public addresses file and update the
	ip configuration of the running daemon.
      </p><p>
      Procedure to update the public address configuration on a single node:
      </p><p>
      1, Update the /etc/ctdb/public_addresses file on the node
      </p><p>
      2, Run 'ctdb reloadips' on the node.
      </p><p>
	The file will then be reloaded on the node and addresses will be added
	or removed as required to match the newly loaded file. When updating
	a single node it may take a little while before any newly added
	 addresses are failed onto the node.
      </p><p>
      </p><p>
      Procedure to update the public address configuration on whole cluster:
      </p><p>
      1, Update the /etc/ctdb/public_addresses file on all nodes
      </p><p>
      2, Run 'ctdb reloadips -n all'.
      </p><p>
	This command will then force all nodes to reload and update the
	addresses. This process is controlled and synchronized by the recovery
	master to ensure that all addresses are added to all nodes as one
	single operation, after which any required ip node rebalancing may
	may take place.

        This command will will send a TCP tickle to the source host for the
        specified TCP connection.
	A TCP tickle is a TCP ACK packet with an invalid sequence and 
	acknowledge number and will when received by the source host result
        in it sending an immediate correct ACK back to the other end.
      </p><p>
        TCP tickles are useful to "tickle" clients after a IP failover has 
        occured since this will make the client immediately recognize the 
        TCP connection has been disrupted and that the client will need
        to reestablish. This greatly speeds up the time it takes for a client
        to detect and reestablish after an IP failover in the ctdb cluster.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="gettickles &lt;ip&gt;"><a name="idp3296504"></a><h3>gettickles &lt;ip&gt;</h3><p>
	This command is used to show which TCP connections are registered with

      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="repack [max_freelist]"><a name="idp3297152"></a><h3>repack [max_freelist]</h3><p>
	Over time, when records are created and deleted in a TDB, the TDB list of free space will become fragmented. This can lead to a slowdown in accessing TDB records.
	This command is used to defragment a TDB database and pruning the freelist.
      </p><p>
	If [max_freelist] is specified, then a database will only be repacked if it has more than this number of entries in the freelist.
	</p><p>
	During repacking of the database, the entire TDB database will be locked to prevent writes. If samba tries to write to a record in the database during a repack operation, samba will block until the repacking has completed.
      </p><p>
	This command can be disruptive and can cause samba to block for the duration of the repack operation. In general, a repack operation will take less than one second to complete.
      </p><p>
	A repack operation will only defragment the local TDB copy of the CTDB database. You need to run this command on all of the nodes to repack a CTDB database completely.
	</p><p>
	Example: ctdb repack 1000
      </p><p>
	 By default, this operation is issued from the 00.ctdb event script every 5 minutes.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="vacuum [max_records]"><a name="idp3299928"></a><h3>vacuum [max_records]</h3><p>
	Over time CTDB databases will fill up with empty deleted records which will lead to a progressive slow down of CTDB database access.
	This command is used to prune all databases and delete all empty records from the cluster.
      </p><p>
	 By default, vacuum will delete all empty records from all databases.
	 If [max_records] is specified, the command will only delete the first
	 [max_records] empty records for each database.
      </p><p>
	 Vacuum only deletes records where the local node is the lmaster.
	 To delete all records from the entire cluster you need to run a vacuum from each node.

	 This command is not disruptive. Samba is unaffected and will still be able to read/write records normally while the database is being vacuumed.
      </p><p>
	Example: ctdb vacuum
      </p><p>
	 By default, this operation is issued from the 00.ctdb event script every 5 minutes.

        This command can be used to copy the entire content of a database out to a file. This file can later be read back into ctdb using the restoredb command.
This is mainly useful for backing up persistent databases such as secrets.tdb and similar.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="restoredb &lt;file&gt; [&lt;dbname&gt;]"><a name="idp3302952"></a><h3>restoredb &lt;file&gt; [&lt;dbname&gt;]</h3><p>
        This command restores a persistent database that was previously backed up using backupdb.
	By default the data will be restored back into the same database as
	it was created from. By specifying dbname you can restore the data
	into a different database.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="wipedb &lt;dbname&gt;"><a name="idp3303808"></a><h3>wipedb &lt;dbname&gt;</h3><p>

	In addition to the normal logging to a log file,
	CTDBD also keeps a in-memory ringbuffer containing the most recent
	log entries for all log levels (except DEBUG).
      </p><p>
	This is useful since it allows for keeping continuous logs to a file
	at a reasonable non-verbose level, but shortly after an incident has
	occured, a much more detailed log can be pulled from memory. This
	can allow you to avoid having to reproduce an issue due to the
	on-disk logs being of insufficient detail.
      </p><p>
	This command extracts all messages of level or lower log level
	from memory and prints it to the screen.  The level is not
	specified it defaults to NOTICE.
      </p><p>
	By default, logs are extracted from the main CTDB daemon.  If
	the recoverd option is given then logs are extracted from the
	recovery daemon.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="clearlog [recoverd]"><a name="idp3306480"></a><h3>clearlog [recoverd]</h3><p>
	This command clears the in-memory logging ringbuffer.

        This command will enable the ReadOnly record support for a database.
	This is an experimental feature to improve performance for contended
	records primarily in locking.tdb and brlock.tdb.
	When enabling this feature you must set it on all nodes in the cluster.
	For now, this feature requires a special patch to samba in order to

    </p><div class="refsect2" title="process-exists &lt;pid&gt;"><a name="idp3308920"></a><h3>process-exists &lt;pid&gt;</h3><p>
        This command checks if a specific process exists on the CTDB host. This is mainly used by Samba to check if remote instances of samba are still running or not.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="getdbmap"><a name="idp3309656"></a><h3>getdbmap</h3><p>
        This command lists all clustered TDB databases that the CTDB daemon has attached to. Some databases are flagged as PERSISTENT, this means that the database stores data persistently and the data will remain across reboots. One example of such a database is secrets.tdb where information about how the cluster was joined to the domain is stored.
      </p><p>
	If a PERSISTENT database is not in a healthy state the database is
	flagged as UNHEALTHY. If there's at least one completely healthy node running in
	the cluster, it's possible that the content is restored by a recovery
	run automaticly. Otherwise an administrator needs to analyze the
	problem.

	Most databases are not persistent and only store the state information that the currently running samba daemons need. These databases are always wiped when ctdb/samba starts and when a node is rebooted.

      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="getmonmode"><a name="idp3319144"></a><h3>getmonmode</h3><p>
        This command returns the monutoring mode of a node. The monitoring mode is either ACTIVE or DISABLED. Normally a node will continuously monitor that all other nodes that are expected are in fact connected and that they respond to commands.
      </p><p>
        ACTIVE - This is the normal mode. The node is actively monitoring all other nodes, both that the transport is connected and also that the node responds to commands. If a node becomes unavailable, it will be marked as DISCONNECTED and a recovery is initiated to restore the cluster.
      </p><p>
        DISABLED - This node is not monitoring that other nodes are available. In this mode a node failure will not be detected and no recovery will be performed. This mode is useful when for debugging purposes one wants to attach GDB to a ctdb process but wants to prevent the rest of the cluster from marking this node as DISCONNECTED and do a recovery.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="setmonmode &lt;0|1&gt;"><a name="idp3320976"></a><h3>setmonmode &lt;0|1&gt;</h3><p>
        This command can be used to explicitly disable/enable monitoring mode on a node. The main purpose is if one wants to attach GDB to a running ctdb daemon but wants to prevent the other nodes from marking it as DISCONNECTED and issuing a recovery. To do this, set monitoring mode to 0 on all nodes before attaching with GDB. Remember to set monitoring mode back to 1 afterwards.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="attach &lt;dbname&gt; [persistent]"><a name="idp3321888"></a><h3>attach &lt;dbname&gt; [persistent]</h3><p>
        This is a debugging command. This command will make the CTDB daemon create a new CTDB database and attach to it.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="dumpmemory"><a name="idp3322608"></a><h3>dumpmemory</h3><p>
        This is a debugging command. This command will make the ctdb

      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="rddumpmemory"><a name="idp3323280"></a><h3>rddumpmemory</h3><p>
        This is a debugging command. This command will dump the talloc memory

        This is a debugging command. This command can be used to manually
	invoke and run the eventscritps with arbitrary arguments.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="ban &lt;bantime|0&gt;"><a name="idp3325176"></a><h3>ban &lt;bantime|0&gt;</h3><p>
        Administratively ban a node for bantime seconds. A bantime of 0 means that the node should be permanently banned. 
      </p><p>
        A banned node does not participate in the cluster and does not host any records for the clustered TDB. Its ip address has been taken over by another node and no services are hosted.
      </p><p>
        Nodes are automatically banned if they are the cause of too many
        cluster recoveries.
      </p><p>
	This is primarily a testing command. Note that the recovery daemon controls the overall ban state and it may automatically unban nodes at will. Meaning that a node that has been banned by the administrator can and ofter are unbanned before the admin specifid timeout triggers. If wanting to "drop" a node out from the cluster for mainentance or other reasons, use the "stop" / "continue" commands instad of "ban" / "unban". 
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="unban"><a name="idp3327216"></a><h3>unban</h3><p>
        This command is used to unban a node that has either been 
        administratively banned using the ban command or has been automatically
        banned by the recovery daemon.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" title="check_srvids &lt;srvid&gt; ..."><a name="idp3327928"></a><h3>check_srvids &lt;srvid&gt; ...</h3><p>
	This command checks whether a set of srvid message ports are registered on the
	node or not. The command takes a list of values to check.
      </p><p>
	Example: ctdb check_srvids 1 2 3 14765
      </p><p>
	Example output:
