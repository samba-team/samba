      ctdb is a utility to view and manage a ctdb cluster.
    </p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id2480890"></a><h2>OPTIONS</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">-n &lt;pnn&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>
            This specifies the physical node number on which to execute the 
	    command. Default is to run the command on the deamon running on 
	    the local host.
	  </p><p>
	    The physical node number is an integer that describes the node in the
	    cluster. The first node has physical node number 0.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-Y</span></dt><dd><p>
            Produce output in machine readable form for easier parsing by scripts. Not all commands support this option.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-t &lt;timeout&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>
            How long should ctdb wait for the local ctdb daemon to respond to a command before timing out. Default is 3 seconds.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-T &lt;timelimit&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>
            A limit on how long the ctdb command will run for before it will
	    be aborted. When this timelimit has been exceeded the ctdb command will
	    terminate.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-? --help</span></dt><dd><p>
            Print some help text to the screen.

            You only need to specify this parameter if you run multiple ctdb 
            daemons on the same physical host and thus can not use the default
            name for the domain socket.

      These are commands used to monitor and administrate a CTDB cluster.
    </p><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2481210"></a><h3>status</h3><p>
        This command shows the current status of the ctdb node.
      </p><div class="refsect3" lang="en"><a name="id2481219"></a><h4>node status</h4><p>
          Node status reflects the current status of the node. There are four possible states:
        </p><p>
          OK - This node is fully functional.
        </p><p>
          DISCONNECTED - This node could not be connected through the network and is currently not participating in the cluster. If there is a public IP address associated with this node it should have been taken over by a different node. No services are running on this node.
        </p><p>
          DISABLED - This node has been administratively disabled. This node is still functional and participates in the CTDB cluster but its IP addresses have been taken over by a different node and no services are currently being hosted.
        </p><p>
          UNHEALTHY - A service provided by this node is malfunctioning and should be investigated. The CTDB daemon itself is operational and participates in the cluster. Its public IP address has been taken over by a different node and no services are currnetly being hosted. All unhealthy nodes should be investigated and require an administrative action to rectify.
        </p><p>
          BANNED - This node failed too many recovery attempts and has been banned from participating in the cluster for a period of RecoveryBanPeriod seconds. Any public IP address has been taken over by other nodes. This node does not provide any services. All banned nodes should be investigated and require an administrative action to rectify. This node does not perticipate in the CTDB cluster but can still be communicated with. I.e. ctdb commands can be sent to it.
        </p></div><div class="refsect3" lang="en"><a name="id2481270"></a><h4>generation</h4><p>
          The generation id is a number that indicates the current generation 
          of a cluster instance. Each time a cluster goes through a 
          reconfiguration or a recovery its generation id will be changed.
	  </p><p>
	  This number does not have any particular meaning other than to keep
	  track of when a cluster has gone through a recovery. It is a random
	  number that represents the current instance of a ctdb cluster
	  and its databases.
	  CTDBD uses this number internally to be able to tell when commands 
	  to operate on the cluster and the databases was issued in a different
	  generation of the cluster, to ensure that commands that operate
	  on the databases will not survive across a cluster database recovery.
	  After a recovery, all old outstanding commands will automatically
	  become invalid. 
        </p><p>
	  Sometimes this number will be shown as "INVALID". This only means that
	  the ctdbd daemon has started but it has not yet merged with the cluster through a recovery.
	  All nodes start with generation "INVALID" and are not assigned a real
	  generation id until they have successfully been merged with a cluster
	  through a recovery.
        </p></div><div class="refsect3" lang="en"><a name="id2481306"></a><h4>VNNMAP</h4><p>
          The list of Virtual Node Numbers. This is a list of all nodes that actively participates in the cluster and that share the workload of hosting the Clustered TDB database records.
          Only nodes that are participating in the vnnmap can become lmaster or dmaster for a database record.
        </p></div><div class="refsect3" lang="en"><a name="id2481320"></a><h4>Recovery mode</h4><p>
          This is the current recovery mode of the cluster. There are two possible modes:
        </p><p>
          NORMAL - The cluster is fully operational.
        </p><p>
          RECOVERY - The cluster databases have all been frozen, pausing all services while the cluster awaits a recovery process to complete. A recovery process should finish within seconds. If a cluster is stuck in the RECOVERY state this would indicate a cluster malfunction which needs to be investigated.
        </p><p>
	Once the recovery master detects an inconsistency, for example a node 
	becomes disconnected/connected, the recovery daemon will trigger a 
	cluster recovery process, where all databases are remerged across the
	cluster. When this process starts, the recovery master will first
	"freeze" all databases to prevent applications such as samba from 
	accessing the databases and it will also mark the recovery mode as
	RECOVERY.
	</p><p>
	When CTDBD starts up, it will start in RECOVERY mode.
	Once the node has been merged into a cluster and all databases
	have been recovered, the node mode will change into NORMAL mode
	and the databases will be "thawed", allowing samba to access the
	databases again.
	</p></div><div class="refsect3" lang="en"><a name="id2528425"></a><h4>Recovery master</h4><p>
          This is the cluster node that is currently designated as the recovery master. This node is responsible of monitoring the consistency of the cluster and to perform the actual recovery process when reqired.
        </p><p>
	Only one node at a time can be the designated recovery master. Which
	node is designated the recovery master is decided by an election
	process in the recovery daemons running on each node.

	Example: ctdb statisticsreset
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528633"></a><h3>getdebug</h3><p>
        Get the current debug level for the node. the debug level controls what information is written to the log file.
      </p><p>
	The debug levels are mapped to the corresponding syslog levels.
	When a debug level is set, only those messages at that level and higher

      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528675"></a><h3>getpid</h3><p>
        This command will return the process id of the ctdb daemon.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528685"></a><h3>disable</h3><p>
        This command is used to administratively disable a node in the cluster.
        A disabled node will still participate in the cluster and host
        clustered TDB records but its public ip address has been taken over by
        a different node and it no longer hosts any services.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528699"></a><h3>enable</h3><p>
        Re-enable a node that has been administratively disabled.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528709"></a><h3>ban &lt;bantime|0&gt;</h3><p>
        Administratively ban a node for bantime seconds. A bantime of 0 means that the node should be permanently banned. 
      </p><p>
        A banned node does not participate in the cluster and does not host any records for the clustered TDB. Its ip address has been taken over by an other node and no services are hosted.
      </p><p>
        Nodes are automatically banned if they are the cause of too many
        cluster recoveries.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528732"></a><h3>moveip &lt;public_ip&gt; &lt;node&gt;</h3><p>
      This command can be used to manually fail a public ip address to a
      specific node.
      </p><p>
      In order to manually override the "automatic" distribution of public 
      ip addresses that ctdb normally provides, this command only works
      when you have changed the tunables for the daemon to:
      </p><p>
      DeterministicIPs = 0
      </p><p>
      NoIPFailback = 1
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528757"></a><h3>unban</h3><p>
        This command is used to unban a node that has either been 
        administratively banned using the ban command or has been automatically
        banned by the recovery daemon.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528769"></a><h3>shutdown</h3><p>
        This command will shutdown a specific CTDB daemon.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528779"></a><h3>recover</h3><p>
        This command will trigger the recovery daemon to do a cluster
        recovery.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528789"></a><h3>killtcp &lt;srcip:port&gt; &lt;dstip:port&gt;</h3><p>
        This command will kill the specified TCP connection by issuing a
        TCP RST to the srcip:port endpoint.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528801"></a><h3>reloadnodes</h3><p>
      This command is used when adding new nodes to an existing cluster and
      to reduce the disruption of this operation. This command should never
      be used except when expanding an existing cluster.
      This can only be used to expand a cluster. To remove a node from the
      cluster you still need to shut down ctdb on all nodes, edit the nodes file
      and restart ctdb.
      </p><p>
      Procedure:
      </p><p>
      1, To expand an existing cluster, first ensure with 'ctdb status' that
      all nodes are up and running and that they are all healthy.
      Do not try to expand a cluster unless it is completely healthy!
      </p><p>
      2, On all nodes, edit /etc/ctdb/nodes and add the new node as the last
      entry to the file. The new node MUST be added to the end of this file!
      </p><p>
      3, Verify that all the nodes have identical /etc/ctdb/nodes files after you edited them and added the new node!
      </p><p>
      4, Run 'ctdb reloadnodes' to force all nodes to reaload the nodesfile.
      </p><p>
      5, Use 'ctdb status' on all nodes and verify that they now show the additional node.
      </p><p>
      6, Install and configure the new node and bring it online.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528853"></a><h3>tickle &lt;srcip:port&gt; &lt;dstip:port&gt;</h3><p>
        This command will will send a TCP tickle to the source host for the
        specified TCP connection.
	A TCP tickle is a TCP ACK packet with an invalid sequence and 
	acknowledge number and will when received by the source host result
        in it sending an immediate correct ACK back to the other end.
      </p><p>
        TCP tickles are useful to "tickle" clients after a IP failover has 
        occured since this will make the client immediately recognize the 
        TCP connection has been disrupted and that the client will need
        to reestablish. This greatly speeds up the time it takes for a client
        to detect and reestablish after an IP failover in the ctdb cluster.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528877"></a><h3>repack [max_freelist]</h3><p>
	Over time, when records are created and deleted in a TDB, the TDB list of free space will become fragmented. This can lead to a slowdown in accessing TDB records.
	This command is used to defragment a TDB database and pruning the freelist.
      </p><p>
	If [max_freelist] is specified, then a database will only be repacked if it has more than this number of entries in the freelist.
	</p><p>
	During repacking of the database, the entire TDB database will be locked to prevent writes. If samba tries to write to a record in the database during a repack operation, samba will block until the repacking has completed.
      </p><p>
	This command can be disruptive and can cause samba to block for the duration of the repack operation. In general, a repack operation will take less than one second to complete.
      </p><p>
	A repack operation will only defragment the local TDB copy of the CTDB database. You need to run this command on all of the nodes to repack a CTDB database completely.
	</p><p>
	Example: ctdb repack 1000
      </p><p>
	 By default, this operation is issued from the 00.ctdb event script every 5 minutes.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528924"></a><h3>vacuum [max_records]</h3><p>
	Over time CTDB databases will fill up with empty deleted records which will lead to a progressive slow down of CTDB database access.
	This command is used to prune all databases and delete all empty records from the cluster.
      </p><p>
	 By default, vacuum will delete all empty records from all databases.
	 If [max_records] is specified, the command will only delete the first
	 [max_records] empty records for each database.
      </p><p>
	 Vacuum only deletes records where the local node is the lmaster.
	 To delete all records from the entire cluster you need to run a vacuum from each node.

	 This command is not disruptive. Samba is unaffected and will still be able to read/write records normally while the database is being vacuumed.
      </p><p>
	Example: ctdb vacuum
      </p><p>
	 By default, this operation is issued from the 00.ctdb event script every 5 minutes.
      </p></div></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id2528961"></a><h2>Debugging Commands</h2><p>
      These commands are primarily used for CTDB development and testing and
      should not be used for normal administration.
    </p><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528971"></a><h3>process-exists &lt;pid&gt;</h3><p>
        This command checks if a specific process exists on the CTDB host. This is mainly used by Samba to check if remote instances of samba are still running or not.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2528983"></a><h3>getdbmap</h3><p>
        This command lists all clustered TDB databases that the CTDB daemon has attached to. Some databases are flagged as PERSISTENT, this means that the database stores data persistently and the data will remain across reboots. One example of such a database is secrets.tdb where information about how the cluster was joined to the domain is stored.

	Most databases are not persistent and only store the state information that the currently running samba daemons need. These databases are always wiped when ctdb/samba starts and when a node is rebooted.

        This command will dump a clustered TDB database to the screen. This is a debugging command.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2529040"></a><h3>getmonmode</h3><p>
        This command returns the monutoring mode of a node. The monitoring mode is either ACTIVE or DISABLED. Normally a node will continously monitor that all other nodes that are expected are in fact connected and that they respond to commands.
      </p><p>
        ACTIVE - This is the normal mode. The node is actively monitoring all other nodes, both that the transport is connected and also that the node responds to commands. If a node becomes unavailable, it will be marked as DISCONNECTED and a recovery is initiated to restore the cluster.
      </p><p>
        DISABLED - This node is not monitoring that other nodes are available. In this mode a node failure will not be detected and no recovery will be performed. This mode is useful when for debugging purposes one wants to attach GDB to a ctdb process but wants to prevent the rest of the cluster from marking this node as DISCONNECTED and do a recovery.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2529071"></a><h3>setmonmode &lt;0|1&gt;</h3><p>
        This command can be used to explicitely disable/enable monitoring mode on a node. The main purpose is if one wants to attach GDB to a running ctdb daemon but wants to prevent the other nodes from marking it as DISCONNECTED and issuing a recovery. To do this, set monitoring mode to 0 on all nodes before attaching with GDB. Remember to set monitoring mode back to 1 afterwards.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2529087"></a><h3>attach &lt;dbname&gt;</h3><p>
        This is a debugging command. This command will make the CTDB daemon create a new CTDB database and attach to it.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2529098"></a><h3>dumpmemory</h3><p>
        This is a debugging command. This command will make the ctdb
        daemon to write a fill memory allocation map to standard output.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2529109"></a><h3>freeze</h3><p>
        This command will lock all the local TDB databases causing clients 
        that are accessing these TDBs such as samba3 to block until the
        databases are thawed.
      </p><p>
        This is primarily used by the recovery daemon to stop all samba
        daemons from accessing any databases while the database is recovered
        and rebuilt.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id2529128"></a><h3>thaw</h3><p>
        Thaw a previously frozen node.
