onnode unit tests
=================

Examples:

* ../run_tests.sh .

  Run all tests, displaying output.

* ../run_tests.sh -s .

  Run all tests, displaying output and a summary.

* ../run_tests.sh -sq .

  Run all tests, displaying only a summary.

* ONNODE=onnode-buggy-001 ../run_tests.sh -s .

  Run against stubs/onnode-buggy-001 instead of default onnode version.

  Add more buggy versions of onnode to this directory as bugs are
  fixed to enable test validation using this feature.

* ../run_tests.sh ./009*.sh

  Run only the specified tests.

* ONNODE="bash -x stubs/onnode-buggy-001" ../run_tests.sh ./0090.sh
  ONNODE="bash -x ../../tools/onnode" ../run_tests.sh ./0090.sh

  Debug the specified test or test failure.  The test will fail
  because the bash trace output will be included in the test output.
  However, this at least makes it easy to trace onnode while running
  the test...

  To see if the test pases, the -x can be dropped... so command-line
  editing can be kept to a minimum.
