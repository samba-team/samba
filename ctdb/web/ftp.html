<h1>Setting up clustered FTP</h1>

<h2>Prereqs</h2>
Configure CTDB as above and set it up to use public ipaddresses.<br>
Verify that the CTDB cluster works.

<h2>Configuration</h2>

Setting up a vsftpd cluster is really easy.<br>
Configure vsftpd on each node on the cluster.<br><br>
Set up vsftpd to export directories from the shared cluster filesystem.

<h2>/etc/sysconfig/vsftpd</h2>

Create the file /etc/sysconfig/vsftpd with the content :
<pre>
  CTDB_MANAGES_VSFTPD=yes
</pre>

Disable vsftpd in chkconfig so that it does not start by default. Instead CTDB will start/stop vsftdp as required.
<pre>
  chkconfig vsftpd off
</pre>

<h2>Events script</h2>

The CTDB distribution already comes with an events script for vsftp in the file /etc/ctdb/events.d/40.vsftpd<br><br>
There should not be any need to edit this file.


<h2>Restart your cluster</h2>
Next time your cluster restarts, CTDB will start managing the vsftp service.<br><br>
If the cluster is already in production you may not want to restart the entire cluster since this would disrupt services.<br>

Insted you can just disable/enable the nodes one by one. Once a node becomes enabled again it will start the vsftp service.<br><br>

Follow the procedure below for each node, one node at a time :

<h3>1 Disable the node</h3>
Use the ctdb command to disable the node :
<pre>
  ctdb -n NODE disable
</pre>

<h3>2 Wait until the cluster has recovered</h3>

Use the ctdb tool to monitor until the cluster has recovered, i.e. Recovery mode is NORMAL. This should happen within seconds of when you disabled the node.
<pre>
  ctdb status
</pre>

<h3>3 Enable the node again</h3>

Re-enable the node again which will start the newly configured vsftp service.
<pre>
  ctdb -n NODE enable
</pre>
