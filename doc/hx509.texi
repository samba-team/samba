@node Introduction, What is X.509 ?, Top, Top
@chapter Introduction

hx509 is a somewhat complete X.509 stack

@node What is X.509 ?, Setting up a CA, Introduction, Top
@chapter What is X.509, PKIX, PKCS7 and CMS ? 

X.509 is from the begining created by CCITT (later ITU) for the X.500
directory service. But today when people are talking about X.509 they
are commonly referring to IETF's PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile of the
X.509 v3 certificate standard, as specified in RFC 3280.

ITU continues to develop the X.509 standard together in a complicated
dance with IETF.

X.509 is public key based security system that have associated data
stored within a so called certificate. From the begning X.509 was a
strict hierarchical system with one root. This didn't not work so over
time X.509 got support for multiple policy roots, bridges, and mesh
solutions. You can even use it as a peer to peer system, but this is not
very common.

@section Type of certificates

There are several flavors of certificate in X.509.

@itemize @bullet

@item Trust anchors

Trust anchors are strictly not certificate, but commonly stored in
certificate since they ar easier to handle then. Trust anchor are the
keys that you trust to validate other certificate. This is done by
building a path from the certificate you wan to validate to to any of
the trust anchors you have.

@item End Entity (EE) certificates

End entity certificates is the most common type of certificate. End
entity certificates can't issue certificate them-self and is used to
authenticate and authorize user and services.

@item Certification Authority (CA) certificates

Certificate authority are certificates that have the right to issue
other certificate, they may be End entity certificates or Certificate
Authority certificates. There is no limit to how many certificates a CA
may issue, but there might other restrictions, like the maximum path
deepth.

@item Proxy certificates

Remember that End Entity can't issue certificates by them own, its not
really true. There there is an extension called proxy certificates,
defined in RFC3820, that allows certificates to be issued by end entity
certificates. The service that receives the proxy certificates must have
explicitly turned on support for proxy certificates, so their use is
somewhat limited.

@end itemize

@section Building a path

The certificate tell who issued the certificate, by name or Key
Identifier.
