Abstract


   This document defines a mechanism to enable in-band transmission of
   OCSP responses.  These responses are used to verify the validity of
   the certificates used in PKINIT - the Kerberos Version 5 extension
   that provides for the use of public key cryptography.

1.  Introduction


   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [RFC2560] enables
   applications to obtain timely information regarding the revocation
   status of a certificate.  Because OCSP responses are well-bounded and
   small in size, constrained clients may wish to use OCSP to check the
   validity of KDC certificates in order to avoid transmission of large
   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and therefore save bandwidth on
   constrained networks.


   This document defines a pre-authentication type [CLARIFICATIONS],
   where the client and the KDC MAY piggyback OCSP responses for
   certificates used in authentication exchanges, as defined in
   [PKINIT].


   By using this OPTIONAL extension, PKINIT clients and the KDC can
   maximize the reuse of cached OCSP responses.

3.  Message Definition


   A pre-authentication type identifier is defined for this mechanism:


              PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE              16


   The corresponding pre-authentication field contains OCSP data as
   follows:


          PA-PK-OCSP-DATA ::= SEQUENCE OF OcspResponse


          OcspResponse ::= OCTET STRING
                         -- contains a complete OCSP response,
                         -- defined in [RFC2560]


   The client MAY send OCSP responses for certificates used in
   PA-PK-AS-REQ [PKINIT] via a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE.


   The KDC that receives a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE the SHOULD send a
   PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE in response.  The client can request a
   PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE by using an empty sequence in its request.


   The KDC MAY send a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE when it does not receive a
   PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE from the client.


   The PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE sent by the KDC contains OCSP responses for
   certificates used in PA-PK-AS-REP [PKINIT].


   Note the lack of integrity protection for the empty or missing OCSP
   response; lack of an expected OCSP response from the KDC for the
   KDC's certificates SHOULD be treated as an error by the client,
   unless it is configured otherwise.


   When using OCSP, the response is signed by the OCSP server, which is
   trusted by the receiver.  Depending on local policy, further
   verification of the validity of the OCSP servers MAY need to be done.


   The client and the KDC SHOULD ignore invalid OCSP responses received
   via this mechanism, and they MAY implement CRL processing logic as a
   fall-back position, if the OCSP responses received via this mechanism
   alone are not sufficient for the verification of certificate
   validity.  The client and/or the KDC MAY ignore a valid OCSP response
   and perform their own revocation status verification independently.

4.  Security Considerations


   The pre-authentication data in this document do not actually
   authenticate any principals, and MUST be used in conjunction with
   PKINIT.


   There is a downgrade attack against clients which want OCSP responses
   from the KDC for the KDC's certificates.  The clients, however, can
   treat the absence of valid OCSP responses as an error, based on their
   local configuration.

5.  IANA Considerations


   This document defines a new pre-authentication type for use with
   PKINIT to encode OCSP responses.  The official value for this padata
   identifier need to be acquired from IANA.
