	<para>This option controls the number of worker processes that are
		started for each service when prefork process model is enabled.
		The prefork children are only started for those services that
		support prefork (currently only ldap). For processes that don't
		support preforking all requests are handled by a single process
		for that service.
	</para>

	<para>This should be set to a small multiple of the number of CPU's
		available on the server</para>

	<para>Additionally the number of prefork children can be specified for
		an individual service by using "prefork children: service name"
		i.e. "prefork children:ldap = 8" to set the number of ldap
		worker processes.</para>
