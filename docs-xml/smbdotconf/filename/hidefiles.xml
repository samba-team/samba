	<para>This is a list of files or directories that are not 
	visible but are accessible.  The DOS 'hidden' attribute is applied 
	to any files or directories that match.</para>

	<para>Each entry in the list must be separated by a '/', 
	which allows spaces to be included in the entry.  '*'
	and '?' can be used to specify multiple files or directories 
	as in DOS wildcards.</para>

	<para>
	<smbconfoption name="hide files"/> can also be used as a
	parametric option where NAME in</para>

	<para>
	hide files : NAME =
	</para>

	<para>
	specifies a user or group name with the same syntax as
	<smbconfoption name="valid users"/>. This parametric form can
	be specified multiple times for different users or
	groups. This means that &quot;hide files : NAME&quot; set both
	in the [global] and the share section add up, whereas normally
	options set in a share section overwrite the default in the
	[global] section.
	</para>

	<para>Each entry must be a Unix path, not a DOS path and must 
	not include the Unix directory separator '/'.</para>

	<para>Note that the case sensitivity option is applicable 
	in hiding files.</para>
		
	<para>Setting this parameter will affect the performance of Samba, 
	as it will be forced to check all files and directories for a match 
	as they are scanned.</para>

	<para>
	The example shown above is based on files that the Macintosh 
	SMB client (DAVE) available from <ulink url="http://www.thursby.com"> 
	Thursby</ulink> creates for internal use, and also still hides 
	all files beginning with a dot.
	</para>

	<para>
	An example of us of this parameter is:
<programlisting>
hide files = /.*/DesktopFolderDB/TrashFor%m/resource.frk/

; Hide some files for anyone and some files for specific users and groups
hide files = /hideforall1/
hide files : USER = /hidetoforuser/
hide files : GROUP = /hideforgroup/
hide files : UNIVERSITY\Alumnis = /somefile.txt/
hide files : john@university.org = /anotherfile.txt/
hide files : S-1-5-21-123-456-789-1000 = /secretfile.txt/

</programlisting>
