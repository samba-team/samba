	<para>
	This boolean option tells <command moreinfo="none">smbd</command> whether to
	globally negotiate SMB2 leases on file open requests. Leasing is an SMB2-only
	feature which allows clients to aggressively cache files locally above and
	beyond the caching allowed by SMB1 oplocks. This (experimental) parameter is
	set to off by default until the SMB2 leasing code is declared fully stable.
	</para>

	<para>
	This is only available with <smbconfoption name="oplocks">yes</smbconfoption>
	and <smbconfoption name="kernel oplocks">no</smbconfoption>.
	</para>

	<para>Note that the write cache won't be used for file handles with a smb2 write lease.</para>

	<para>
	The Samba implementation of leases is currently marked as experimental!
