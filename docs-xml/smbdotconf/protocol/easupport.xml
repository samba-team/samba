    <para>This boolean parameter controls whether <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>                                       
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> will allow clients to attempt to access extended
    attributes on a share. In order to enable this parameter on a setup with default VFS modules:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Samba must have been built with extended attributes support.
	</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>The underlying filesystem exposed by the share must support extended
	attributes (e.g. the getfattr<manvolnum>1</manvolnum> / setfattr<manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
	utilities must work).
	</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
    Note that the SMB protocol allows setting attributes whose value is 64K bytes long,
    and that on NTFS, the maximum storage space for extended attributes per file is 64K.
    On most UNIX systems (Solaris and ZFS file system being the exception), the limits
    are much lower - typically 4K. Worse, the same 4K space is often used to store
    system metadata such as POSIX ACLs, or Samba's NT ACLs. Giving clients
    access to this tight space via extended attribute support could consume all
    of it by unsuspecting client applications, which would prevent changing
    system metadata due to lack of space.

    The default has changed to yes in Samba release 4.9.0 and above to allow better Windows
    fileserver compatibility in a default install.
