    <para>Hosts running the "Advanced Server for Unix (ASU)" product
    require some special accommodations such as creating a builtin [ADMIN$]
    share that only supports IPC connections.  The has been the default
    behavior in smbd for many years.  However, certain Microsoft applications
    such as the Print Migrator tool require that the remote server support
    an [ADMIN$] file share.  Disabling this parameter allows for creating
    an [ADMIN$] file share in smb.conf.</para>
