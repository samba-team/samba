	<para>This option controls the maximum depth that winbindd
              will traverse when flattening nested group memberships
	      of Windows domain groups.  This is different from the
	      <smbconfoption name="winbind nested groups"/> option
              which implements the Windows NT4 model of local group 
	      nesting.  The &quot;winbind expand groups&quot;
              parameter specifically applies to the membership of 
	      domain groups.</para>

	 <para>Be aware that a high value for this parameter can
	 result in system slowdown as the main parent winbindd daemon
	 must perform the group unrolling and will be unable to answer
	 incoming NSS or authentication requests during this time.</para>

	<para>The default value was changed from 1 to 0 with Samba 4.2.
	Some broken applications calculate the group memberships of
	users by traversing groups, such applications will require
	"winbind expand groups = 1". But the new default makes winbindd more reliable
	as it doesn't require SAMR access to domain controllers of trusted domains.</para>
