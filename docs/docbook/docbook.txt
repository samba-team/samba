What are DocBook documents doing in the Samba Distribution ?
-----------------------------------------------------------

We have converted all samba docs to XML/DocBook V4.2
in order to make them easier to maintain and produce a nicer looking
product.

This short note (strange isn't it how it always starts out as a short note
and becomes a long one ?) will explain very briefly how and why we have
done this.


The format
----------
If you are new to xml, regard an xml file as 'source code'. You don't
read it directly, but use it to create other formats (like the txt and html
included in ../txtdocs and ../htmldocs).

Docbook is a particular XML style, particularly suited to producing
technical manuals. 

For more information on DocBook tags and format, see "DocBook: The 
Definitive Guide" by Walsh and Muellner, (c) O'Reilly Publishing.
This book covers DocBook V4.2 and is available on-line
at http://www.docbook.org/

The Output
----------
The current Samba CVS tree contains the XML/DocBook source files as well 
as the following autogenerated formats:

  * man pages
  * HTML
  * PDF

The following formats are not available in CVS but can be generated by 
the build scripts:

  * PostScript
  * DVI
  * LaTeX
  * ASCII text

The Tools
---------

To generate the docs, you need to have the following packages installed:

 * docbook-utils
 * xsltproc
 * pngtopnm and pnmtops (from the netpbm utilities)

For generating PDF (thru LaTeX):
 * pdflatex

For generating PostScript (thru LaTeX):
 * latex
 * dvips 

For generating ASCII:
 * xmlto 

This directory now contains a ./configure script and Makefile to 
support the automated building of man pages (including HTML versions), and 
the building of the Samba-HOWTO-Collection and the 
Samba Developers Guide (HTML,DVI,TeX,PDF,PS,Text versions).
