	<title>SYNOPSIS</title>

	<para>The <filename>smb.conf</filename> file is a configuration 
	file for the Samba suite. <filename>smb.conf</filename> contains 
	runtime configuration information for the Samba programs. The
	<filename>smb.conf</filename> file is designed to be configured and 
	administered by the <ulink url="swat.8.html"><command>swat(8)</command>
	</ulink> program. The complete description of the file format and 
	possible parameters held within are here for reference purposes.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1>
	<title id="FILEFORMATSECT">FILE FORMAT</title>

	<para>The file consists of sections and parameters. A section 
	begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues 
	until the next section begins. Sections contain parameters of the 
	form</para>

	<para><replaceable>name</replaceable> = <replaceable>value
	</replaceable></para>

	<para>The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated 
	line represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter.</para>

	<para>Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.</para>

	<para>Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant. 
	Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded. 
	Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter 
	names is irrelevant. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter 
	value is discarded. Internal whitespace within a parameter value 
	is retained verbatim.</para>

	<para>Any line beginning with a semicolon (';') or a hash ('#') 
	character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.</para>

	<para>Any line ending in a '\' is continued
	on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion.</para>

	<para>The values following the equals sign in parameters are all 
	either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given 
	as yes/no, 0/1 or true/false. Case is not significant in boolean 
	values, but is preserved in string values. Some items such as 
	create modes are numeric.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1>
	<title>SECTION DESCRIPTIONS</title>

	<para>Each section in the configuration file (except for the
	[global] section) describes a shared resource (known
	as a "share"). The section name is the name of the 
	shared resource and the parameters within the section define 
	the shares attributes.</para>

	<para>There are three special sections, [global],
	[homes] and [printers], which are
	described under <emphasis>special sections</emphasis>. The
	following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions.</para>

	<para>A share consists of a directory to which access is being 
	given plus a description of the access rights which are granted 
	to the user of the service. Some housekeeping options are 
	also specifiable.</para>
	
	<para>Sections are either file share services (used by the 
	client as an extension of their native file systems) or 
	printable services (used by the client to access print services 
	on the host running the server).</para>
	
	<para>Sections may be designated <emphasis>guest</emphasis> services, 
	in which case no password is required to access them. A specified 
	UNIX <emphasis>guest account</emphasis> is used to define access
	privileges in this case.</para>

	<para>Sections other than guest services will require a password 
	to access them. The client provides the username. As older clients 
	only provide passwords and not usernames, you may specify a list 
	of usernames to check against the password using the "user =" 
	option in the share definition. For modern clients such as 
	Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000, this should not be necessary.</para>

	<para>Note that the access rights granted by the server are 
	masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest 
	UNIX user by the host system. The server does not grant more
	access than the host system grants.</para>
	
	<para>The following sample section defines a file space share. 
	The user has write access to the path <filename>/home/bar</filename>. 
	The share is accessed via the share name "foo":</para>

	<screen>
	<computeroutput>
 	[foo]
 		path = /home/bar
 		writeable = true
	</computeroutput>
	</screen>

	<para>The following sample section defines a printable share. 
	The share is readonly, but printable. That is, the only write 
	access permitted is via calls to open, write to and close a 
	spool file. The <emphasis>guest ok</emphasis> parameter means 
	access will be permitted as the default guest user (specified 
	elsewhere):</para>

	<screen>
	<computeroutput>
 	[aprinter]
 		path = /usr/spool/public
 		writeable = false
 		printable = true
 		guest ok = true
	</computeroutput>
	</screen>
</refsect1>

<refsect1>
	<title>SPECIAL SECTIONS</title>
	
	<refsect2>
		<title>The [global] section</title>
		
		<para>parameters in this section apply to the server 
		as a whole, or are defaults for sections which do not 
		specifically define certain items. See the notes 
		under PARAMETERS for more information.</para>
	</refsect2>
	
	<refsect2>
		<title id="HOMESECT">The [homes] section</title>
		
		<para>If a section called homes is included in the 
		configuration file, services connecting clients to their 
		home directories can be created on the fly by the server.</para>

		<para>When the connection request is made, the existing 
		sections are scanned. If a match is found, it is used. If no 
		match is found, the requested section name is treated as a 
		user name and looked up in the local password file. If the 
		name exists and the correct password has been given, a share is 
		created by cloning the [homes] section.</para>
		
		<para>Some modifications are then made to the newly 
		created share:</para>
		
		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>The share name is changed from homes to 
		the located username.</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>If no path was given, the path is set to
		the user's home directory.</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>If you decide to use a <emphasis>path =</emphasis> line 
		in your [homes] section then you may find it useful 
		to use the %S macro. For example :</para>

		<para><userinput>path = /data/pchome/%S</userinput></para>

		<para>would be useful if you have different home directories 
		for your PCs than for UNIX access.</para>

		<para>This is a fast and simple way to give a large number 
		of clients access to their home directories with a minimum 
		of fuss.</para>

		<para>A similar process occurs if the requested section 
		name is "homes", except that the share name is not 
		changed to that of the requesting user. This method of using 
		the [homes] section works well if different users share 
		a client PC.</para>
		
		<para>The [homes] section can specify all the parameters 
		a normal service section can specify, though some make more sense 
		than others. The following is a typical and suitable [homes]
		section:</para>

		<screen>
		<computeroutput>
	 	[homes]
 			writeable = yes
		</computeroutput>
		</screen>
	
		<para>An important point is that if guest access is specified 
		in the [homes] section, all home directories will be 
		visible to all clients <emphasis>without a password</emphasis>. 
		In the very unlikely event that this is actually desirable, it 
		would be wise to also specify <emphasis>read only
		access</emphasis>.</para>

		<para>Note that the <emphasis>browseable</emphasis> flag for 
		auto home directories will be inherited from the global browseable 
		flag, not the [homes] browseable flag. This is useful as 
		it means setting <emphasis>browseable = no</emphasis> in
		the [homes] section will hide the [homes] share but make
		any auto home directories visible.</para>
	</refsect2>
	
	<refsect2>
		<title id="PRINTERSSECT">The [printers] section</title>
		
		<para>This section works like [homes], 
		but for printers.</para>

		<para>If a [printers] section occurs in the 
		configuration file, users are able to connect to any printer 
		specified in the local host's printcap file.</para>

		<para>When a connection request is made, the existing sections 
		are scanned. If a match is found, it is used. If no match is found, 
		but a [homes] section exists, it is used as described
		above. Otherwise, the requested section name is treated as a 
		printer name and the appropriate printcap file is scanned to see 
		if the requested section name is a valid printer share name. If 
		a match is found, a new printer share is created by cloning 
		the [printers] section.</para>

		<para>A few modifications are then made to the newly created 
		share:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>The share name is set to the located printer 
		name</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>If no printer name was given, the printer name 
		is set to the located printer name</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>If the share does not permit guest access and 
		no username was given, the username is set to the located 
		printer name.</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>Note that the [printers] service MUST be 
		printable - if you specify otherwise, the server will refuse 
		to load the configuration file.</para>
		
		<para>Typically the path specified would be that of a 
		world-writeable spool directory with the sticky bit set on 
		it. A typical [printers] entry would look like 
		this:</para>

		<screen><computeroutput>
	 	[printers]
 			path = /usr/spool/public
 			guest ok = yes
 			printable = yes 
		</computeroutput></screen>

		<para>All aliases given for a printer in the printcap file 
		are legitimate printer names as far as the server is concerned. 
		If your printing subsystem doesn't work like that, you will have 
		to set up a pseudo-printcap. This is a file consisting of one or 
		more lines like this:</para>

		<screen>
		<computeroutput>
	        alias|alias|alias|alias...    
		</computeroutput>
		</screen>

		<para>Each alias should be an acceptable printer name for 
		your printing subsystem. In the [global] section, specify 
		the new file as your printcap.  The server will then only recognize 
		names found in your pseudo-printcap, which of course can contain 
		whatever aliases you like. The same technique could be used 
		simply to limit access to a subset of your local printers.</para>

		<para>An alias, by the way, is defined as any component of the 
		first entry of a printcap record. Records are separated by newlines,
		components (if there are more than one) are separated by vertical 
		bar symbols ('|').</para>
		
		<para>NOTE: On SYSV systems which use lpstat to determine what 
		printers are defined on the system you may be able to use
		"printcap name = lpstat" to automatically obtain a list 
		of printers. See the "printcap name" option 
		for more details.</para>
	</refsect2>
</refsect1>

<refsect1>
	<title>PARAMETERS</title>

	<para>parameters define the specific attributes of sections.</para>

	<para>Some parameters are specific to the [global] section
	(e.g., <emphasis>security</emphasis>).  Some parameters are usable 
	in all sections (e.g., <emphasis>create mode</emphasis>). All others 
	are permissible only in normal sections. For the purposes of the 
	following descriptions the [homes] and [printers]
	sections will be considered normal.  The letter <emphasis>G</emphasis> 
	in parentheses indicates that a parameter is specific to the
	[global] section. The letter <emphasis>S</emphasis>
	indicates that a parameter can be specified in a service specific
	section. Note that all <emphasis>S</emphasis> parameters can also be specified in 
	the [global] section - in which case they will define
	the default behavior for all services.</para>

	<para>parameters are arranged here in alphabetical order - this may 
	not create best bedfellows, but at least you can find them! Where 
	there are synonyms, the preferred synonym is described, others refer 
	to the preferred synonym.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1>
	<title>VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS</title>

	<para>Many of the strings that are settable in the config file 
	can take substitutions. For example the option "path =
	/tmp/%u" would be interpreted as "path = 
	/tmp/john" if the user connected with the username john.</para>

	<para>These substitutions are mostly noted in the descriptions below, 
	but there are some general substitutions which apply whenever they 
	might be relevant. These are:</para>

	<title id="NAMEMANGLINGSECT">NAME MANGLING</title>
	
	<para>Samba supports "name mangling" so that DOS and

	It can also be set to adjust the case of 8.3 format filenames.</para>

	<title id="VALIDATIONSECT">NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION</title>

	<para>There are a number of ways in which a user can connect

	steps succeeds, then the following steps are not checked.</para>

		<para>In order to use this option, <ulink url="smbd.8.html">smbd</ulink>

		<para>When the Windows user attempts to access the Samba server,

		As unicast packets are received on the other sockets it allows

		is only when Samba is a domain member does it get the information

		<parameter>security = server</parameter> mode a missing user
		is treated the same as an invalid password logon attempt. Deleting
		the user in this circumstance would not be a good idea.</para>

		<para>When the Windows user attempts to access the Samba server, 
		at <emphasis>login</emphasis> (session setup in the SMB protocol) 
		time, <command>smbd</command> contacts the <link linkend="PASSWORDSERVER">

		<para>See the section on <link linkend="NAMEMANGLINGSECT">

		<para>If mangling is used then the mangling algorithm is as follows:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>The first (up to) five alphanumeric characters 
			before the rightmost dot of the filename are preserved, forced 
			to upper case, and appear as the first (up to) five characters 
			of the mangled name.</para></listitem>
		
			<listitem><para>A tilde "~" is appended to the first part of the mangled
			name, followed by a two-character unique sequence, based on the
			original root name (i.e., the original filename minus its final
			extension). The final extension is included in the hash calculation
			only if it contains any upper case characters or is longer than three
			characters.</para>

			<para>Note that the character to use may be specified using 
			the <link linkend="MANGLINGCHAR"><parameter>mangling char</parameter>
			</link> option, if you don't like '~'.</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>The first three alphanumeric characters of the final 
			extension are preserved, forced to upper case and appear as the 
			extension of the mangled name. The final extension is defined as that

			dots in the filename, the mangled name will have no extension (except 
			in the case of "hidden files" - see below).</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>Files whose UNIX name begins with a dot will be

			underscores).</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>The two-digit hash value consists of upper case

		<para>This algorithm can cause name collisions only if files

		The probability of such a clash is 1/1300.</para>

		<para>The name mangling (if enabled) allows a file to be

		<para>The differentiating

		<listitem><para>Multiple users may be specified in a comma-delimited

		<para>The <parameter>username</parameter> line is needed only when

		usernames to UNIX usernames. In both these cases you may also be 
		better using the \\server\share%user syntax instead.</para>

		<para>The <parameter>username</parameter> line is not a great

		You may get timeouts or security breaches using this parameter

		<para>Samba relies on the underlying UNIX security. This

		<term><anchor id="USERNAMEMAP">username map (G)</term>
		<listitem><para>This option allows you to specify a file containing 
		a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server. This can be 
		used for several purposes. The most common is to map usernames 
		that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX 
		box uses. The other is to map multiple users to a single username 
		so that they can more easily share files.</para>

		<para>The map file is parsed line by line. Each line should 
		contain a single UNIX username on the left then a '=' followed 
		by a list of usernames on the right. The list of usernames on the 
		right may contain names of the form @group in which case they 
		will match any UNIX username in that group. The special client 
		name '*' is a wildcard and matches any name. Each line of the 
		map file may be up to 1023 characters long.</para>

		<para>The file is processed on each line by taking the 
		supplied username and comparing it with each username on the right 
		hand side of the '=' signs. If the supplied name matches any of 
		the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the name 
		on the left. Processing then continues with the next line.</para>

		<para>If any line begins with a '#' or a ';' then it is 
		ignored</para>

		<para>If any line begins with an '!' then the processing 
		will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the line. 
		Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed. 
		Using '!' is most useful when you have a wildcard mapping line 
		later in the file.</para>
		
		<para>For example to map from the name <constant>admin</constant> 
		or <constant>administrator</constant> to the UNIX name <constant>
		root</constant> you would use:</para>

		<para><command>root = admin administrator</command></para>

		<para>Or to map anyone in the UNIX group <constant>system</constant> 
		to the UNIX name <constant>sys</constant> you would use:</para>

		<para><command>sys = @system</command></para>

		<para>You can have as many mappings as you like in a username 
		map file.</para>
		
		
		<para>If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then 
		the netgroup database is checked before the <filename>/etc/group
		</filename> database for matching groups.</para>

		<para>You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them
		 by using double quotes around the name. For example:</para>

		<para><command>tridge = "Andrew Tridgell"</command></para>

		<para>would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the 
		unix username "tridge".</para>

		<para>The following example would map mary and fred to the 
		unix user sys, and map the rest to guest. Note the use of the 
		'!' to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on 
		that line.</para>

		<para><programlisting>
		!sys = mary fred
		guest = *
		</programlisting></para>

		<para>Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences 
		of usernames. Thus if you connect to \\server\fred and <constant>
		fred</constant> is remapped to <constant>mary</constant> then you 
		will actually be connecting to \\server\mary and will need to 
		supply a password suitable for <constant>mary</constant> not 
		<constant>fred</constant>. The only exception to this is the 
		username passed to the <link linkend="PASSWORDSERVER"><parameter>
		password server</parameter></link> (if you have one). The password 
		server will receive whatever username the client supplies without 
		modification.</para>

		<para>Also note that no reverse mapping is done. The main effect 
		this has is with printing. Users who have been mapped may have 
		trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think 
		they don't own the print job.</para>

	<title>WARNINGS</title>
	
	<para>Although the configuration file permits service names 
	to contain spaces, your client software may not. Spaces will 
	be ignored in comparisons anyway, so it shouldn't be a 
	problem - but be aware of the possibility.</para>

	<para>On a similar note, many clients - especially DOS clients - 
	limit service names to eight characters. <ulink url="smbd.8.html">smbd(8)
	</ulink> has no such limitation, but attempts to connect from such 
	clients will fail if they truncate the service names.  For this reason 
	you should probably keep your service names down to eight characters 
	in length.</para>

	<para>Use of the [homes] and [printers] special sections make life 
	for an administrator easy, but the various combinations of default 
	attributes can be tricky. Take extreme care when designing these 
	sections. In particular, ensure that the permissions on spool 
	directories are correct.</para>
