<title>File, Directory and Share Access Controls</title>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>ACLs</primary></indexterm>
Advanced MS Windows users are frequently perplexed when file, directory and share manipulation of
resources shared via Samba do not behave in the manner they might expect. MS Windows network
administrators are often confused regarding network access controls and how to
provide users with the access they need while protecting resources from unauthorized access.
</para>

<para>
Many UNIX administrators are unfamiliar with the MS Windows environment and in particular
have difficulty in visualizing what the MS Windows user wishes to achieve in attempts to set file
and directory access permissions. 
</para>

<para>
The problem lies in the differences in how file and directory permissions and controls work
between the two environments. This difference is one that Samba cannot completely hide, even
though it does try to bridge the chasm to a degree.
</para>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>Extended Attributes</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>ACLs</primary><secondary>POSIX</secondary></indexterm>

POSIX Access Control List technology has been available (along with Extended Attributes)
for UNIX for many years, yet there is little evidence today of any significant use. This
explains to some extent the slow adoption of ACLs into commercial Linux products. MS Windows
administrators are astounded at this, given that ACLs were a foundational capability of the now
decade-old MS Windows NT operating system.
</para>

<para>
The purpose of this chapter is to present each of the points of control that are possible with
Samba-3 in the hope that this will help the network administrator to find the optimum method
for delivering the best environment for MS Windows desktop users.
</para>

<para>
This is an opportune point to mention that Samba was created to provide a means of interoperability
and interchange of data between differing operating environments. Samba has no intent to change
UNIX/Linux into a platform like MS Windows. Instead the purpose was and is to provide a sufficient
level of exchange of data between the two environments. What is available today extends well
beyond early plans and expectations, yet the gap continues to shrink.

			<para>
			Samba honors and implements UNIX file system access controls. Users

			This information is passed to the Samba server as part of the logon or
			connection setup process. Samba uses this user identity to validate

			(files and directories). This chapter provides an overview for those

			The use of POSIX ACLs on UNIX/Linux is possible only if the underlying

			this. Sadly, few Linux platforms ship today with native ACLs and
			Extended Attributes enabled. This chapter has pertinent information

<title>File System Access Controls</title>

<para>
Perhaps the most important recognition to be made is the simple fact that MS Windows NT4/200x/XP
implement a totally divergent file system technology from what is provided in the UNIX operating system
environment. First we consider what the most significant differences are, then we look
at how Samba helps to bridge the differences.

	Samba operates on top of the UNIX file system. This means it is subject to UNIX file system conventions
	and permissions. It also means that if the MS Windows networking environment requires file system
	behavior that differs from UNIX file system behavior then somehow Samba is responsible for emulating
	that in a transparent and consistent manner.
	</para>

	<para>
	It is good news that Samba does this to a large extent and on top of that provides a high degree
	of optional configuration to override the default behavior. We look at some of these over-rides,
	but for the greater part we will stay within the bounds of default behavior. Those wishing to explore
	the depths of control ability should review the &smb.conf; man page.

	<para>The following compares file system features for UNIX with those of Microsoft Windows NT/200x:

	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Name Space</term>
			<listitem>
		<para>
		MS Windows NT4/200x/XP files names may be up to 254 characters long, and UNIX file names
		may be 1023 characters long. In MS Windows, file extensions indicate particular file types,
		in UNIX this is not so rigorously observed as all names are considered arbitrary. 
		</para>

			<listitem>
		<para>
		<indexterm><primary>8.3 file names</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>File System</primary><secondary>case sensitivity</secondary></indexterm>
		MS Windows file names are generally upper case if made up of 8.3 (8 character file name
		and 3 character extension. File names that are longer than 8.3 are case preserving and case
		insensitive.
		</para>

		<para>
		UNIX file and directory names are case sensitive and case preserving. Samba implements the
		MS Windows file name behavior, but it does so as a user application. The UNIX file system
		provides no mechanism to perform case insensitive file name lookups. MS Windows does this
		by default. This means that Samba has to carry the processing overhead to provide features
		that are not native to the UNIX operating system environment.
		</para>
		<para>
		Consider the following. All are unique UNIX names but one single MS Windows file name:
		<screen>
				MYFILE.TXT
				MyFile.txt
				myfile.txt
		</screen></para>

		<para>
		So clearly, in an MS Windows file name space these three files cannot co-exist, but in UNIX
		they can.
		</para>
		<para>
		So what should Samba do if all three are present? That which is lexically first will be
		accessible to MS Windows users, the others are invisible and unaccessible &smbmdash; any
		other solution would be suicidal.

		the forward-slash <constant>/</constant> as its directory delimiter. This is handled transparently by Samba.

		<para>
			<indexterm><primary>Drive Identification</primary></indexterm>
		MS Windows products support a notion of drive letters, like <command>C:</command> to represent
		disk partitions. UNIX has no concept of separate identifiers for file partitions, each
		such file system is mounted to become part of the overall directory tree.

		MS Windows generally never experiences file names that begin with a dot (<constant>.</constant>) while in UNIX these
		are commonly found in a user's home directory. Files that begin with a dot (<constant>.</constant>) are typically
		either start-up files for various UNIX applications, or they may be files that contain

		<indexterm><primary>Short-Cuts</primary></indexterm>
		MS Windows make use of <quote>links and short-cuts</quote> that are actually special types of files that will
		redirect an attempt to execute the file to the real location of the file. UNIX knows of file and directory
		links, but they are entirely different from what MS Windows users are used to.
		</para>
		<para>
		Symbolic links are files in UNIX that contain the actual location of the data (file or directory). An
		operation (like read or write) will operate directly on the file referenced. Symbolic links are also
		referred to as <quote>soft links.</quote> A hard link is something that MS Windows is not familiar with. It allows
		one physical file to be known simultaneously by more than one file name.

	<title>File and Directory Access Control</title>


	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>ACLs</primary><secondary>File System</secondary></indexterm>
	The network administrator is strongly advised to read foundational training manuals and reference materials
	regarding file and directory permissions maintenance. Much can be achieved with the basic UNIX permissions
	without having to resort to more complex facilities like POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Extended
	Attributes (EAs).
	</para>

	<para>
	UNIX/Linux file and directory access permissions involves setting three primary sets of data and one control set.
	A UNIX file listing looks as follows:

	Any bit flag may be unset. An unset bit flag is the equivalent of <quote>cannot</quote> and is represented as a <quote>-</quote> character.

	<example>
		<title>Example File</title>

		-rwxr-x---   Means: The owner (user) can read, write, execute
		                    the group can read and execute
		                    everyone else cannot do anything with it.
		</programlisting>
	</example>

	</para>

	<para>
	Additional possibilities in the [type] field are: c = character device, b = block device, p = pipe device, s = UNIX Domain Socket.
	</para>

	<para>
	The letters <constant>rwxXst</constant> set permissions for the user, group and others as: read (r), write (w), execute (or access for directories) (x),
	execute  only  if  the  file  is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s),
	sticky (t).
	</para>

	<para>
	When the sticky bit is set on a directory, files in that directory may be unlinked (deleted) or renamed only by root or their owner. 
	Without the sticky  bit, anyone able to write to the directory can delete or rename files. The sticky bit is commonly found on
	directories, such as <filename>/tmp</filename>, that are world-writable.
	</para>

	<para>
	When the set user or group ID bit (s) is set on a directory, then all files created within it will be owned by the user and/or
	group whose `set user or group' bit is set. This can be helpful in setting up directories for which it is desired that
	all users who are in a group should be able to write to and read from a file, particularly when it is undesirable for that file
	to be exclusively owned by a user whose primary group is not the group that all such users belong to.
	</para>

	<para>
	When a directory is set <constant>drw-r-----</constant> this means that the owner can read and create (write) files in it, but because
	the (x) execute flags are not set, files cannot be listed (seen) in the directory by anyone. The group can read files in the
	directory but cannot create new files. If files in the directory are set to be readable and writable for the group, then
	group members will be able to write to (or delete) them.

<title>Share Definition Access Controls</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>permissions</primary><secondary>share</secondary></indexterm>
The following parameters in the &smb.conf; file sections define a share control or effect access controls.
Before using any of the following options, please refer to the man page for &smb.conf;.
</para>

	<sect2>
	<title>User and Group-Based Controls</title>

	<para>
	User and group-based controls can prove quite useful. In some situations it is distinctly desirable to affect all
	file system operations as if a single user were doing so. The use of the <smbconfoption><name>force user</name></smbconfoption> and 
	<smbconfoption><name>force group</name></smbconfoption> behavior will achieve this. In other situations it may be necessary to effect a
	paranoia level of control to ensure that only particular authorized persons will be able to access a share or
	its contents. Here the use of the <smbconfoption><name>valid users</name></smbconfoption> or the
	<smbconfoption><name>invalid users</name></smbconfoption> may be most useful.
	</para>

	<para>
	As always, it is highly advisable to use the least difficult to maintain and the least ambiguous method for
	controlling access. Remember, when you leave the scene someone else will need to provide assistance and
	if he finds too great a mess or does not understand what you have done, there is risk of
	Samba being removed and an alternative solution being adopted.

<title>Access Controls on Shares</title>


	<para>
<indexterm><primary>permissions</primary><secondary>share ACLs</secondary></indexterm>
	This section deals with how to configure Samba per share access control restrictions.
	By default, Samba sets no restrictions on the share itself. Restrictions on the share itself
	can be set on MS Windows NT4/200x/XP shares. This can be an effective way to limit who can
	connect to a share. In the absence of specific restrictions the default setting is to allow
	the global user <constant>Everyone - Full Control</constant> (full control, change and read).
	</para>

	<para>
	At this time Samba does not provide a tool for configuring access control setting on the share
	itself. Samba does have the capacity to store and act on access control settings, but  the only
	way to create those settings is to use either the NT4 Server Manager or the Windows 200x MMC for
	Computer Management.
	</para>

	<para>
	Samba stores the per share access control settings in a file called <filename>share_info.tdb</filename>.
	The location of this file on your system will depend on how Samba was compiled. The default location
	for Samba's tdb files is under <filename>/usr/local/samba/var</filename>. If the <filename>tdbdump</filename>
	utility has been compiled and installed on your system, then you can examine the contents of this file
	by executing: <command>tdbdump share_info.tdb</command> in the directory containing the tdb files.

			<title>Windows 200x/XP</title>

			<para>
			On <application>MS Windows NT4/200x/XP</application> system access control lists on the share itself are set using native

			</procedure>

			<warning>
			<para>
			Be careful. If you take away all permissions from the <constant>Everyone</constant> user without removing this user,
			effectively no user will be able to access the share. This is a result of what is known as
			ACL precedence. Everyone with <emphasis>no access</emphasis> means that <constant>MaryK</constant> who is part of the group 
			<constant>Everyone</constant> will have no access even if she is given explicit full control access.

		<title>Managing UNIX Permissions Using NT Security Dialogs</title>


		<para>
<indexterm><primary>permissions</primary><secondary>file/directory ACLs</secondary></indexterm>
		Windows NT clients can use their native security settings dialog box to view and modify the
		underlying UNIX permissions.
		</para>

		<para>
		This ability is careful not to compromise the security of the UNIX host on which Samba is running, and 
		still obeys all the file permission rules that a Samba administrator can set.
		</para>

		<para>
		Samba does not attempt to go beyond POSIX ACLs, so the various finer-grained access control
		options provided in Windows are actually ignored.
		</para> 

		<note>
		<para>
		All access to UNIX/Linux system files via Samba is controlled by the operating system file access controls.
		When trying to figure out file access problems, it is vitally important to find the identity of the Windows
		user as it is presented by Samba at the point of file access. This can best be determined from the
		Samba log files.
		</para>
		</note>

	<sect2>
		<title>Viewing File Security on a Samba Share</title>

		<para>
		From an NT4/2000/XP client, right click on any file or directory in a Samba-mounted drive letter
		or UNC path. When the menu pops up, click on the <guilabel>Properties</guilabel> entry at the bottom
		of the menu. This brings up the file <constant>Properties</constant> dialog box. Click on the 
		<guilabel>Security</guilabel> tab and you will see three buttons: <guibutton>Permissions</guibutton>,
		<guibutton>Auditing</guibutton>, and <guibutton>Ownership</guibutton>. The <guibutton>Auditing</guibutton>
		button will cause either an error message <errorname>`A requested privilege is not held by the client'</errorname>
		to appear if the user is not the NT Administrator, or a dialog which is intended to allow an Administrator
		to add auditing requirements to a file if the user is logged on as the NT Administrator. This dialog is
		non-functional with a Samba share at this time, as the only useful button, the <guibutton>Add</guibutton>
		button, will not currently allow a list of users to be seen.
		</para>

	</sect2>

	<sect2>
		<title>Viewing File Ownership</title>

		<para>
		Clicking on the <guibutton>Ownership</guibutton> button brings up a dialog box telling you who owns
		the given file. The owner name will be displayed like this:
		</para>

		<para>
		<command><quote>SERVER\user (Long name)</quote></command>
		</para>

		<para>
		<replaceable>SERVER</replaceable> is the NetBIOS name of the Samba server, <replaceable>user</replaceable>
		is the user name of the UNIX user who owns the file, and <replaceable>(Long name)</replaceable> is the
		descriptive string identifying the user (normally found in the GECOS field of the UNIX password database).
		Click on the <guibutton>Close </guibutton> button to remove this dialog.
		</para>

		<para>
		If the parameter <smbconfoption><name>nt acl support</name></smbconfoption> is set to <constant>false</constant>,
		the file owner will be shown as the NT user <emphasis>Everyone</emphasis>.
		</para>

		<para>
		The <guibutton>Take Ownership</guibutton> button will not allow you to change the ownership of this file to
		yourself (clicking it will display a dialog box complaining that the user you are currently logged onto
		the NT client cannot be found). The reason for this is that changing the ownership of a file is a privileged
		operation in UNIX, available only to the <emphasis>root</emphasis> user. As clicking on this button causes
		NT to attempt to change the ownership of a file to the current user logged into the NT clienti, this will
		not work with Samba at this time.</para>

		<para>
		There is an NT <command>chown</command> command that will work with Samba and allow a user with Administrator privilege connected 
		to a Samba server as root to change the ownership of files on both a local NTFS filesystem or remote mounted NTFS 
		or Samba drive. This is available as part of the <application>Seclib</application> NT security library written
		by Jeremy Allison of the Samba Team, and is available from the main Samba FTP site.</para>

	</sect2>

	<sect2>
		<title>Viewing File or Directory Permissions</title>

		<para>
		The third button is the <guibutton>Permissions</guibutton> button. Clicking on this brings up a dialog box
		that shows both the permissions and the UNIX owner of the file or directory. The owner is displayed like this:
		</para>

		<para><command><replaceable>SERVER</replaceable>\
				<replaceable>user</replaceable> 
				<replaceable>(Long name)</replaceable></command></para>

		<para>Where <replaceable>SERVER</replaceable> is the NetBIOS name of the Samba server,
		<replaceable>user</replaceable> is the user name of the UNIX user who owns the file, and
		<replaceable>(Long name)</replaceable> is the descriptive string identifying the user (normally found in the
		GECOS field of the UNIX password database).</para>

		<para>
		If the parameter <smbconfoption><name>nt acl support</name></smbconfoption> is set to <constant>false</constant>,
		the file owner will be shown as the NT user <constant>Everyone</constant> and the permissions will be
		shown as NT <quote>Full Control</quote>.
		</para>


		<para>
		The permissions field is displayed differently for files and directories, so I'll describe the way file permissions 
		are displayed first.
		</para>

		<sect3>
			<title>File Permissions</title>

			<para>The standard UNIX user/group/world triplet and the corresponding <constant>read, write, execute</constant> permissions 
			triplets are mapped by Samba into a three element NT ACL with the <quote>r</quote>, <quote>w</quote> and <quote>x</quote> bits mapped into the corresponding 
			NT permissions. The UNIX world permissions are mapped into the global NT group <constant>Everyone</constant>, followed 
			by the list of permissions allowed for UNIX world. The UNIX owner and group permissions are displayed as an NT 
			<guiicon>user</guiicon> icon and an NT <guiicon>local group</guiicon> icon, respectively, followed by the list 
			of permissions allowed for the UNIX user and group.</para>

			<para>Because many UNIX permission sets do not map into common NT names such as <constant>read</constant>,
			<constant>change</constant> or <constant>full control</constant>, usually the permissions will be prefixed
			by the words <constant>Special Access</constant> in the NT display list.</para>

			<para>But what happens if the file has no permissions allowed for a particular UNIX user group or world component? In order 
			to  allow <quote>no permissions</quote> to be seen and modified Samba then overloads the NT <constant>Take Ownership</constant> ACL attribute 
			(which has no meaning in UNIX) and reports a component with no permissions as having the NT <command>O</command> bit set. 
			This was chosen, of course, to make it look like a zero, meaning zero permissions. More details on the decision behind this is 
			given below.</para>
		</sect3>
		
		<sect3>
			<title>Directory Permissions</title>

			<para>Directories on an NT NTFS file system have two different sets of permissions. The first set is the ACL set on the
			directory itself, which is usually displayed in the first set of parentheses in the normal <constant>RW</constant> 
			NT style. This first set of permissions is created by Samba in exactly the same way as normal file permissions are, described 
			above, and is displayed in the same way.</para>

			<para>The second set of directory permissions has no real meaning in the UNIX permissions world and represents the <constant>
			inherited</constant> permissions that any file created within this directory would inherit.</para>

			<para>Samba synthesises these inherited permissions for NT by returning as an NT ACL the UNIX permission mode that a new file 
			created by Samba on this share would receive.</para>
		</sect3>
	</sect2>
		
	<sect2>
		<title>Modifying File or Directory Permissions</title>

		<para>Modifying file and directory permissions is as simple 
		as changing the displayed permissions in the dialog box, and 
		clicking on <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. However, there are 
		limitations that a user needs to be aware of, and also interactions 
		with the standard Samba permission masks and mapping of DOS 
		attributes that need to also be taken into account.</para>

		<para>If the parameter <smbconfoption><name>nt acl support</name></smbconfoption>
		is set to <constant>false</constant>, any attempt to set 
		security permissions will fail with an <errorname>`Access Denied'
		</errorname> message.</para>

		<para>The first thing to note is that the <guibutton>Add</guibutton> 
		button will not return a list of users in Samba (it will give 
		an error message saying <errorname>`The remote procedure call failed 
		and did not execute'</errorname>). This means that you can only 
		manipulate the current user/group/world permissions listed in 
		the dialog box. This actually works quite well as these are the 
		only permissions that UNIX actually has.</para>

		<para>If a permission triplet (either user, group, or world) 
		is removed from the list of permissions in the NT dialog box, 
		then when the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button is pressed it will 
		be applied as <quote>no permissions</quote> on the UNIX side. If you then 
		view the permissions again, the <quote>no permissions</quote> entry will appear 
		as the NT <command>O</command> flag, as described above. This 
		allows you to add permissions back to a file or directory once 
		you have removed them from a triplet component.</para>

		<para>As UNIX supports only the <quote>r</quote>, <quote>w</quote> and <quote>x</quote> bits of 
		an NT ACL, if other NT security attributes such as <constant>Delete Access</constant> are
		selected they will be ignored when applied on the Samba server.</para>

		<para>When setting permissions on a directory, the second 
		set of permissions (in the second set of parentheses) is 
		by default applied to all files within that directory. If this 
		is not what you want, you must uncheck the <guilabel>Replace 
		permissions on existing files</guilabel> checkbox in the NT 
		dialog before clicking on <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.</para>

		<para>If you wish to remove all permissions from a 
		user/group/world  component, you may either highlight the 
		component and click on the <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> button, 
		or set the component to only have the special <constant>Take
		Ownership</constant> permission (displayed as <command>O
		</command>) highlighted.</para>
	</sect2>

	<sect2>
		<title>Interaction with the Standard Samba <quote>create mask</quote> Parameters</title>

		<para>There are four parameters that control interaction with the standard Samba <parameter>create mask</parameter> parameters.
		These are:

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><smbconfoption><name>security mask</name></smbconfoption></listitem>
			<listitem><smbconfoption><name>force security mode</name></smbconfoption></listitem>
			<listitem><smbconfoption><name>directory security mask</name></smbconfoption></listitem>
			<listitem><smbconfoption><name>force directory security mode</name></smbconfoption></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		</para>

		<para>Once a user clicks on <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to apply the 
		permissions, Samba maps the given permissions into a user/group/world 
		r/w/x triplet set, and then checks the changed permissions for a 
		file against the bits set in the  
		<smbconfoption><name>security mask</name></smbconfoption> parameter. Any bits that 
		were changed that are not set to <quote>1</quote> in this parameter are left alone 
		in the file permissions.</para>

		<para>Essentially, zero bits in the <smbconfoption><name>security mask</name></smbconfoption>
		may be treated as a set of bits the user is <emphasis>not</emphasis> 
		allowed to change, and one bits are those the user is allowed to change.
		</para>

		<para>If not explicitly set, this parameter defaults to the same value as 
		the <smbconfoption><name>create mask</name></smbconfoption> parameter. To allow a user to modify all the
		user/group/world permissions on a file, set this parameter to 0777.
		</para>

		<para>Next Samba checks the changed permissions for a file against the bits set in the 
		<smbconfoption><name>force security mode</name></smbconfoption> parameter. Any bits 
		that were changed that correspond to bits set to <quote>1</quote> in this parameter 
		are forced to be set.</para>

		<para>Essentially, bits set in the <parameter>force security mode</parameter> parameter
		may be treated as a set of bits that, when modifying security on a file, the user has always set to be <quote>on</quote>.</para>

		<para>If not explicitly set, this parameter defaults to the same value 
		as the <smbconfoption><name>force create mode</name></smbconfoption> parameter.
		To allow a user to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a file
		with no restrictions set this parameter to 000. The
		<smbconfoption><name>security mask</name></smbconfoption> and <parameter>force 
		security mode</parameter> parameters are applied to the change 
		request in that order.</para>

		<para>For a directory, Samba will perform the same operations as 
		described above for a file except it uses the parameter <parameter>
		directory security mask</parameter> instead of <parameter>security 
		mask</parameter>, and <parameter>force directory security mode
		</parameter> parameter instead of <parameter>force security mode
		</parameter>.</para>

		<para>The <smbconfoption><name>directory security mask</name></smbconfoption> parameter 
		by default is set to the same value as the <parameter>directory mask
		</parameter> parameter and the <parameter>force directory security 
		mode</parameter> parameter by default is set to the same value as 
		the <smbconfoption><name>force directory mode</name></smbconfoption> parameter.
		In this way Samba enforces the permission restrictions that 
		an administrator can set on a Samba share, while still allowing users 
		to modify the permission bits within that restriction.</para>

		<para>If you want to set up a share that allows users full control
		in modifying the permission bits on their files and directories and
		does not force any particular bits to be set <quote>on</quote>, then set the following
		parameters in the &smb.conf; file in that share-specific section:
		</para>

		<smbconfblock>
			<smbconfoption><name>security mask</name><value>0777</value></smbconfoption>
			<smbconfoption><name>force security mode</name><value>0</value></smbconfoption>
			<smbconfoption><name>directory security mask</name><value>0777</value></smbconfoption>
			<smbconfoption><name>force directory security mode</name><value>0</value></smbconfoption>
		</smbconfblock>
	</sect2>

	<sect2>
		<title>Interaction with the Standard Samba File Attribute Mapping</title>

		<note>
		<para>Samba maps some of the DOS attribute bits (such as <quote>read 
		only</quote>) into the UNIX permissions of a file. This means there can 
		be a conflict between the permission bits set via the security 
		dialog and the permission bits set by the file attribute mapping.
		</para>
		</note>

		<para>If a file has no UNIX read access for the owner, it will show up
		as <quote>read only</quote> in the standard file attributes tabbed dialog.
		Unfortunately, this dialog is the same one that contains the security information
		in another tab.</para>

		<para>What this can mean is that if the owner changes the permissions
		to allow himself read access using the security dialog, clicks on
		<guibutton>OK</guibutton> to get back to the standard attributes tab 
		dialog, and clicks on <guibutton>OK</guibutton> on that dialog, then 
		NT will set the file permissions back to read-only (as that is what 
		the attributes still say in the dialog). This means that after setting 
		permissions and clicking on <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to get back to the 
		attributes dialog, you should always press <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> 
		rather than <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to ensure that your changes 
		are not overridden.</para>

	<title>Users Cannot Write to a Public Share</title>

	<para>
	<quote>
	We are facing some troubles with file/directory permissions. I can log on the domain as admin user(root),
	and there's a public share on which everyone needs to have permission to create/modify files, but only
	root can change the file, no one else can. We need to constantly go to the server to
	<userinput>chgrp -R users *</userinput> and <userinput>chown -R nobody *</userinput> to allow others users to change the file.
	</quote>
	</para>

	<para>
	There are many ways to solve this problem and here are a few hints:
	</para>

	<procedure>
		<step>
			<para>
			Go to the top of the directory that is shared.

&prompt;find 'directory_name' -type f -exec chown user.group {}\;
</screen>
			</para>

			<note><para>
			The above will set the <constant>sticky bit</constant> on all directories. Read your
			UNIX/Linux man page on what that does. It causes the OS to assign 
			to all files created in the directories the ownership of the 
			directory.
			</para></note>

		<step>
			<para>

			Directory is: <replaceable>/foodbar</replaceable>
<screen>
&prompt;<userinput>chown jack.engr /foodbar</userinput>

&prompt;<userinput>touch Afile</userinput>
&prompt;<userinput>ls -al</userinput>

</screen>
		</para>
		</step>

<smbconfoption><name>force create mode</name><value>0775</value></smbconfoption>
<smbconfoption><name>force direcrtory mode</name><value>6775</value></smbconfoption>

		a temporary name, Word then closes the old document and deletes it, Word then renames the new document to the original document name.
		There is no mechanism by which Samba can in any way know that the new document really should be owned by the owners
		of the original file. Samba has no way of knowing that the file will be renamed by MS Word. As far as Samba is able
		to tell, the file that gets created is a NEW file, not one that the application (Word) is updating.

		There is a work-around to solve the permissions problem. That work-around involves understanding how you can manage file
		system behavior from within the &smb.conf; file, as well as understanding how UNIX file systems work. Set on the directory
		in which you are changing Word documents: <command>chmod g+s `directory_name'</command> This ensures that all files will
		be created with the group that owns the directory. In &smb.conf; share declaration section set:

		<smbconfblock>
                <smbconfoption><name>force create mode</name><value>0660</value></smbconfoption>
                <smbconfoption><name>force directory mode</name><value>0770</value></smbconfoption>
		</smbconfblock>
		</para>

		These two settings will ensure that all directories and files that get created in the share will be read/writable by the
		owner and group set on the directory itself.
