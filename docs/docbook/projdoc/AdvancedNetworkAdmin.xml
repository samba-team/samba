<title>Advanced Network Management</title>

<para>
This section documents peripheral issues that are of great importance to network
administrators who want to improve network resource access control, to automate the user
environment and to make their lives a little easier.

<sect1>
<title>Features and Benefits</title>

<para>
Often the difference between a working network environment and a well appreciated one can
best be measured by the <emphasis>little things</emphasis> that make everything work more
harmoniously. A key part of every network environment solution is the
ability to remotely
manage MS Windows workstations, remotely access the Samba server, provide customized
logon scripts, as well as other housekeeping activities that help to sustain more reliable
network operations.
</para>

<para>
This chapter presents information on each of these areas. They are placed here, and not in
other chapters, for ease of reference.

<title>Remote Desktop Management</title>

<para>
There are a number of possible remote desktop management solutions that range from free
through costly. Do not let that put you off. Sometimes the most costly solution is the
most cost effective. In any case, you will need to draw your own conclusions as to which
is the best tool in your network environment.

	The following information was posted to the Samba mailing list at Apr 3 23:33:50 GMT 2003.
	It is presented in slightly edited form (with author details omitted for privacy reasons).
	The entire answer is reproduced below with some comments removed.
	</para>

		<para><quote>
		I have a wonderful Linux/Samba server running as pdc for a network. Now I would like to add remote
		desktop capabilities so users outside could login to the system and get their desktop up from home or
		another country.
		</quote></para>

		<para><quote>
		Is there a way to accomplish this? Do I need a Windows Terminal Server?  Do I need to configure it so
		it is a member of the domain or a BDC,PDC? Are there any hacks for MS Windows XP to enable remote login
		even if the computer is in a domain?
		</quote></para>

		<para>
		Answer provided: Check out the new offer from NoMachine, <quote>NX</quote> software:
		<ulink noescape="1" url="http://www.nomachine.com/">http://www.nomachine.com/</ulink>.
		</para>

	<para>
	It implements an easy-to-use interface to the Remote X protocol as
	well as incorporating VNC/RFB and rdesktop/RDP into it, but at a speed
	performance much better than anything you may have ever seen.
	</para>

	<para>
	Remote X is not new at all, but what they did achieve successfully is
	a new way of compression and caching technologies that makes the thing
	fast enough to run even over slow modem/ISDN connections.
	</para>

	<para>
	I could test drive their (public) Red Hat machine in Italy, over a loaded
	Internet connection, with enabled thumbnail previews in KDE konqueror
	which popped up immediately on <quote>mouse-over</quote>. From inside that (remote X)
	session I started a rdesktop session on another, a Windows XP machine.
	To test the performance, I played Pinball. I am proud to announce
	that my score was 631750 points at first try.
	</para>

	<para>
	NX performs better on my local LAN than any of the other <quote>pure</quote>
	connection methods I am using from time to time: TightVNC, rdesktop or
	Remote X. It is even faster than a direct crosslink connection between
	two nodes.
	</para>

	<para>
	I even got sound playing from the Remote X app to my local boxes, and
	had a working <quote>copy'n'paste</quote> from an NX  window (running a KDE session
	in Italy) to my Mozilla mailing agent. These guys are certainly doing
	something right!
	</para>

	<para>
	I recommend to test drive NX to anybody with a only a passing interest in remote computing
	<ulink noescape="1" url="http://www.nomachine.com/testdrive.php">http://www.nomachine.com/testdrive.php</ulink>.
	</para>

	<para>
	Just download the free of charge client software (available for Red Hat,
	SuSE, Debian and Windows) and be up and running within five minutes (they
	need to send you your account data, though, because you are assigned
	a real UNIX account on their testdrive.nomachine.com box.
	</para>

	<para>
	They plan to get to the point were you can have NX application servers
	running as a cluster of nodes, and users simply start an NX session locally,
	and can select applications to run transparently (apps may even run on
	another NX node, but pretend to be on the same as used for initial login,
	because it displays in the same window. You also can run it
	fullscreen, and after a short time you forget that it is a remote session
	at all).
	</para>

	<para>
	Now the best thing for last: All the core compression and caching
	technologies are released under the GPL and available as source code
	to anybody who wants to build on it! These technologies are working,
	albeit started from the command line only (and very inconvenient to
	use in order to get a fully running remote X session up and running.)
	</para>

	To answer your questions:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>
		You do not need to install a terminal server; XP has RDP support built in.
		</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>
		NX is much cheaper than Citrix &smbmdash; and comparable in performance, probably faster.
		</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>
		You do not need to hack XP &smbmdash; it just works.
		</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>
		You log into the XP box from remote transparently (and I think there is no
		need to change anything to get a connection, even if authentication is against a domain).
		</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>
		The NX core technologies are all Open Source and released under the GPL &smbmdash;
		you can now use a (very inconvenient) commandline at no cost,
		but you can buy a comfortable (proprietary) NX GUI frontend for money.
		</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>
		NoMachine are encouraging and offering help to OSS/Free Software implementations
		for such a frontend too, even if it means competition to them (they have written
		to this effect even to the LTSP, KDE and GNOME developer mailing lists).

<title>Network Logon Script Magic</title>

<para>
There are several opportunities for creating a custom network startup configuration environment.

	<listitem>No Logon Script.</listitem>
	<listitem>Simple universal Logon Script that applies to all users.</listitem>
	<listitem>Use of a conditional Logon Script that applies per user or per group attributes.</listitem>
	<listitem>Use of Samba's preexec and postexec functions on access to the NETLOGON share to create

<para>
The Samba source code tree includes two logon script generation/execution tools.
See <filename>examples</filename> directory <filename>genlogon</filename> and
<filename>ntlogon</filename> subdirectories.
</para>

<para>
The following listings are from the genlogon directory.

	# genlogon.pl
	#
	# Perl script to generate user logon scripts on the fly, when users
	# connect from a Windows client. This script should be called from 
	# smb.conf with the %U, %G and %L parameters. I.e:
	#
	#       root preexec = genlogon.pl %U %G %L
	#
	# The script generated will perform
	# the following:
	#
	# 1. Log the user connection to /var/log/samba/netlogon.log
	# 2. Set the PC's time to the Linux server time (which is maintained
	#    daily to the National Institute of Standard's Atomic clock on the
	#    internet.
	# 3. Connect the user's home drive to H: (H for Home).
	# 4. Connect common drives that everyone uses.
	# 5. Connect group-specific drives for certain user groups.
	# 6. Connect user-specific drives for certain users.
