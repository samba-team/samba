<title>Integrating MS Windows networks with Samba</title>
 
<para>
This section deals with NetBIOS over TCP/IP name to IP address resolution. If you
your MS Windows clients are NOT configured to use NetBIOS over TCP/IP then this
section does not apply to your installation. If your installation involves use of
NetBIOS over TCP/IP then this section may help you to resolve networking problems.
</para>

<note>
<para>
	NetBIOS over TCP/IP has nothing to do with NetBEUI. NetBEUI is NetBIOS
	over Logical Link Control (LLC). On modern networks it is highly advised
	to NOT run NetBEUI at all. Note also that there is NO such thing as
	NetBEUI over TCP/IP - the existence of such a protocol is a complete
	and utter mis-apprehension.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Since the introduction of MS Windows 2000 it is possible to run MS Windows networking
without the use of NetBIOS over TCP/IP. NetBIOS over TCP/IP uses UDP port 137 for NetBIOS
name resolution and uses TCP port 139 for NetBIOS session services. When NetBIOS over
TCP/IP is disabled on MS Windows 2000 and later clients then only TCP port 445 will be
used and UDP port 137 and TCP port 139 will not.
</para>

<note>
<para>
When using Windows 2000 or later clients, if NetBIOS over TCP/IP is NOT disabled, then
the client will use UDP port 137 (NetBIOS Name Service, also known as the Windows Internet
Name Service or WINS), TCP port 139 AND TCP port 445 (for actual file and print traffic).
</para>
</note>

<para>
When NetBIOS over TCP/IP is disabled the use of DNS is essential. Most installations that
disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP today use MS Active Directory Service (ADS). ADS requires
Dynamic DNS with Service Resource Records (SRV RR) and with Incremental Zone Transfers (IXFR).
Use of DHCP with ADS is recommended as a further means of maintaining central control
over client workstation network configuration.

<title>Name Resolution in a pure Unix/Linux world</title>

<para>
The key configuration files covered in this section are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><filename>/etc/hosts</filename></para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename></para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><filename>/etc/host.conf</filename></para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<sect2>
<title><filename>/etc/hosts</filename></title>

<para>
Contains a static list of IP Addresses and names.
eg:
</para>
<para><programlisting>
	127.0.0.1	localhost localhost.localdomain
	192.168.1.1	bigbox.caldera.com	bigbox	alias4box
</programlisting></para>

<para>
The purpose of <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> is to provide a 
name resolution mechanism so that uses do not need to remember 
IP addresses.
</para>


<para>
Network packets that are sent over the physical network transport 
layer communicate not via IP addresses but rather using the Media 
Access Control address, or MAC address. IP Addresses are currently 
32 bits in length and are typically presented as four (4) decimal 
numbers that are separated by a dot (or period). eg: 168.192.1.1
</para>

<para>
MAC Addresses use 48 bits (or 6 bytes) and are typically represented 
as two digit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons. eg: 
40:8e:0a:12:34:56
</para>

<para>
Every network interfrace must have an MAC address. Associated with 
a MAC address there may be one or more IP addresses. There is NO 
relationship between an IP address and a MAC address, all such assignments 
are arbitary or discretionary in nature. At the most basic level all 
network communications takes place using MAC addressing. Since MAC 
addresses must be globally unique, and generally remains fixed for 
any particular interface, the assignment of an IP address makes sense 
from a network management perspective. More than one IP address can 
be assigned per MAC address. One address must be the primary IP address, 
this is the address that will be returned in the ARP reply.
</para>

<para>
When a user or a process wants to communicate with another machine 
the protocol implementation ensures that the "machine name" or "host 
name" is resolved to an IP address in a manner that is controlled 
by the TCP/IP configuration control files. The file 
<filename>/etc/hosts</filename> is one such file.
</para>

<para>
When the IP address of the destination interface has been 
determined a protocol called ARP/RARP is used to identify 
the MAC address of the target interface. ARP stands for Address 
Resolution Protocol, and is a broadcast oriented method that 
uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to send a request to all 
interfaces on the local network segment using the all 1's MAC 
address. Network interfaces are programmed to respond to two 
MAC addresses only; their own unique address and the address 
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. The reply packet from an ARP request will 
contain the MAC address and the primary IP address for each 
interface.
</para>

<para>
The <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file is foundational to all 
Unix/Linux TCP/IP installations and as a minumum will contain 
the localhost and local network interface IP addresses and the 
primary names by which they are known within the local machine. 
This file helps to prime the pump so that a basic level of name 
resolution can exist before any other method of name resolution 
becomes available.
</para>

<sect2>
<title><filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename></title>

<para>
This file tells the name resolution libraries:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>The name of the domain to which the machine 
	belongs
	</para></listitem>
	
	<listitem><para>The name(s) of any domains that should be 
	automatically searched when trying to resolve unqualified 
	host names to their IP address
	</para></listitem>
	
	<listitem><para>The name or IP address of available Domain 
	Name Servers that may be asked to perform name to address 
	translation lookups
	</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect2>


<sect2>
<title><filename>/etc/host.conf</filename></title>


<para>
<filename>/etc/host.conf</filename> is the primary means by 
which the setting in /etc/resolv.conf may be affected. It is a 
critical configuration file.  This file controls the order by 
which name resolution may procede. The typical structure is:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
	order hosts,bind
	multi on
</programlisting></para>

<para>
then both addresses should be returned. Please refer to the 
man page for host.conf for further details.
</para>


</sect2>



<sect2>
<title><filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename></title>

<para>
This file controls the actual name resolution targets. The 
file typically has resolver object specifications as follows:
</para>


<para><programlisting>
	# /etc/nsswitch.conf
	#
	# Name Service Switch configuration file.
	#

	passwd:		compat
	# Alternative entries for password authentication are:
	# passwd:	compat files nis ldap winbind
	shadow:		compat
	group:		compat

	hosts:		files nis dns
	# Alternative entries for host name resolution are:
	# hosts:	files dns nis nis+ hesoid db compat ldap wins
	networks:	nis files dns

	ethers:		nis files
	protocols:	nis files
	rpc:		nis files
	services:	nis files
</programlisting></para>

<para>
Of course, each of these mechanisms requires that the appropriate 
facilities and/or services are correctly configured.
</para>

<para>
It should be noted that unless a network request/message must be 
sent, TCP/IP networks are silent. All TCP/IP communications assumes a 
principal of speaking only when necessary.
</para>

<para>
Starting with version 2.2.0 samba has Linux support for extensions to 
the name service switch infrastructure so that linux clients will 
be able to obtain resolution of MS Windows NetBIOS names to IP 
Addresses. To gain this functionality Samba needs to be compiled 
with appropriate arguments to the make command (ie: <command>make 
nsswitch/libnss_wins.so</command>). The resulting library should 
then be installed in the <filename>/lib</filename> directory and 
the "wins" parameter needs to be added to the "hosts:" line in 
the <filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename> file. At this point it 
will be possible to ping any MS Windows machine by it's NetBIOS 
machine name, so long as that machine is within the workgroup to 
which both the samba machine and the MS Windows machine belong.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>Name resolution as used within MS Windows networking</title>

<para>
MS Windows networking is predicated about the name each machine 
is given. This name is known variously (and inconsistently) as 
the "computer name", "machine name", "networking name", "netbios name", 
"SMB name". All terms mean the same thing with the exception of 
"netbios name" which can apply also to the name of the workgroup or the 
domain name. The terms "workgroup" and "domain" are really just a 
simply name with which the machine is associated. All NetBIOS names 
are exactly 16 characters in length. The 16th character is reserved. 
It is used to store a one byte value that indicates service level 
information for the NetBIOS name that is registered. A NetBIOS machine 
name is therefore registered for each service type that is provided by 
the client/server.
</para>

<para>
The following are typical NetBIOS name/service type registrations:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
	Unique NetBIOS Names:
		MACHINENAME&lt;00&gt;	= Server Service is running on MACHINENAME
		MACHINENAME&lt;03&gt; = Generic Machine Name (NetBIOS name)
		MACHINENAME&lt;20&gt; = LanMan Server service is running on MACHINENAME
		WORKGROUP&lt;1b&gt; = Domain Master Browser

	Group Names:
		WORKGROUP&lt;03&gt; = Generic Name registered by all members of WORKGROUP
		WORKGROUP&lt;1c&gt; = Domain Controllers / Netlogon Servers
		WORKGROUP&lt;1d&gt; = Local Master Browsers
		WORKGROUP&lt;1e&gt; = Internet Name Resolvers
</programlisting></para>

<para>
It should be noted that all NetBIOS machines register their own 
names as per the above. This is in vast contrast to TCP/IP 
installations where traditionally the system administrator will 
determine in the /etc/hosts or in the DNS database what names 
are associated with each IP address.
</para>

<para>
One further point of clarification should be noted, the <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> 
file and the DNS records do not provide the NetBIOS name type information 
that MS Windows clients depend on to locate the type of service that may 
be needed. An example of this is what happens when an MS Windows client 
wants to locate a domain logon server. It find this service and the IP 
address of a server that provides it by performing a lookup (via a 
NetBIOS broadcast) for enumeration of all machines that have 
registered the name type *&lt;1c&gt;. A logon request is then sent to each 
IP address that is returned in the enumerated list of IP addresses. Which 
ever machine first replies then ends up providing the logon services.
</para>

<para>
The name "workgroup" or "domain" really can be confusing since these 
have the added significance of indicating what is the security 
architecture of the MS Windows network. The term "workgroup" indicates 
that the primary nature of the network environment is that of a 
peer-to-peer design. In a WORKGROUP all machines are responsible for 
their own security, and generally such security is limited to use of 
just a password (known as SHARE MODE security). In most situations 
with peer-to-peer networking the users who control their own machines 
will simply opt to have no security at all. It is possible to have 
USER MODE security in a WORKGROUP environment, thus requiring use 
of a user name and a matching password.
</para>

<para>
MS Windows networking is thus predetermined to use machine names 
for all local and remote machine message passing. The protocol used is 
called Server Message Block (SMB) and this is implemented using 
the NetBIOS protocol (Network Basic Input Output System). NetBIOS can 
be encapsulated using LLC (Logical Link Control) protocol - in which case 
the resulting protocol is called NetBEUI (Network Basic Extended User 
Interface). NetBIOS can also be run over IPX (Internetworking Packet 
Exchange) protocol as used by Novell NetWare, and it can be run 
over TCP/IP protocols - in which case the resulting protocol is called 
NBT or NetBT, the NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
</para>

<para>
MS Windows machines use a complex array of name resolution mechanisms. 
Since we are primarily concerned with TCP/IP this demonstration is 
limited to this area.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>The NetBIOS Name Cache</title>

<para>
All MS Windows machines employ an in memory buffer in which is 
stored the NetBIOS names and IP addresses for all external 
machines that that machine has communicated with over the 
past 10-15 minutes. It is more efficient to obtain an IP address 
for a machine from the local cache than it is to go through all the 
configured name resolution mechanisms.
</para>

<para>
If a machine whose name is in the local name cache has been shut 
down before the name had been expired and flushed from the cache, then 
an attempt to exchange a message with that machine will be subject 
to time-out delays. i.e.: Its name is in the cache, so a name resolution 
lookup will succeed, but the machine can not respond. This can be 
frustrating for users - but it is a characteristic of the protocol.
</para>

<para>
The MS Windows utility that allows examination of the NetBIOS 
name cache is called "nbtstat". The Samba equivalent of this 
is called "nmblookup".
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>The LMHOSTS file</title>

<para>
This file is usually located in MS Windows NT 4.0 or 
2000 in <filename>C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC</filename> and contains 
the IP Address and the machine name in matched pairs. The 
<filename>LMHOSTS</filename> file performs NetBIOS name 
to IP address mapping oriented.
</para>

<para>
It typically looks like:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
	# Copyright (c) 1998 Microsoft Corp.
	#
	# This is a sample LMHOSTS file used by the Microsoft Wins Client (NetBIOS
	# over TCP/IP) stack for Windows98
	#
	# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to NT computernames
	# (NetBIOS) names.  Each entry should be kept on an individual line.
	# The IP address should be placed in the first column followed by the
	# corresponding computername. The address and the comptername
	# should be separated by at least one space or tab. The "#" character
	# is generally used to denote the start of a comment (see the exceptions
	# below).
	#
	# This file is compatible with Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x TCP/IP lmhosts
	# files and offers the following extensions:
	#
	#      #PRE
	#      #DOM:&lt;domain&gt;
	#      #INCLUDE &lt;filename&gt;
	#      #BEGIN_ALTERNATE
	#      #END_ALTERNATE
	#      \0xnn (non-printing character support)
	#
	# Following any entry in the file with the characters "#PRE" will cause
	# the entry to be preloaded into the name cache. By default, entries are
	# not preloaded, but are parsed only after dynamic name resolution fails.
	#
	# Following an entry with the "#DOM:&lt;domain&gt;" tag will associate the
	# entry with the domain specified by &lt;domain&gt;. This affects how the
	# browser and logon services behave in TCP/IP environments. To preload
	# the host name associated with #DOM entry, it is necessary to also add a
	# #PRE to the line. The &lt;domain&gt; is always preloaded although it will not
	# be shown when the name cache is viewed.
	#
	# Specifying "#INCLUDE &lt;filename&gt;" will force the RFC NetBIOS (NBT)
	# software to seek the specified &lt;filename&gt; and parse it as if it were
	# local. &lt;filename&gt; is generally a UNC-based name, allowing a
	# centralized lmhosts file to be maintained on a server.
	# It is ALWAYS necessary to provide a mapping for the IP address of the
	# server prior to the #INCLUDE. This mapping must use the #PRE directive.
	# In addtion the share "public" in the example below must be in the
	# LanManServer list of "NullSessionShares" in order for client machines to
	# be able to read the lmhosts file successfully. This key is under
	# \machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\lanmanserver\parameters\nullsessionshares
	# in the registry. Simply add "public" to the list found there.
	#
	# The #BEGIN_ and #END_ALTERNATE keywords allow multiple #INCLUDE
	# statements to be grouped together. Any single successful include
	# will cause the group to succeed.
	#
	# Finally, non-printing characters can be embedded in mappings by
	# first surrounding the NetBIOS name in quotations, then using the
	# \0xnn notation to specify a hex value for a non-printing character.
	#
	# The following example illustrates all of these extensions:
	#
	# 102.54.94.97     rhino         #PRE #DOM:networking  #net group's DC
	# 102.54.94.102    "appname  \0x14"                    #special app server
	# 102.54.94.123    popular            #PRE             #source server
	# 102.54.94.117    localsrv           #PRE             #needed for the include
	#
	# #BEGIN_ALTERNATE
	# #INCLUDE \\localsrv\public\lmhosts
	# #INCLUDE \\rhino\public\lmhosts
	# #END_ALTERNATE
	#
	# In the above example, the "appname" server contains a special
	# character in its name, the "popular" and "localsrv" server names are
	# preloaded, and the "rhino" server name is specified so it can be used
	# to later #INCLUDE a centrally maintained lmhosts file if the "localsrv"
	# system is unavailable.
	#
	# Note that the whole file is parsed including comments on each lookup,
	# so keeping the number of comments to a minimum will improve performance.
	# Therefore it is not advisable to simply add lmhosts file entries onto the
	# end of this file.

<title>HOSTS file</title>

<para>
This file is usually located in MS Windows NT 4.0 or 2000 in 
<filename>C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC</filename> and contains 
the IP Address and the IP hostname in matched pairs. It can be 
used by the name resolution infrastructure in MS Windows, depending 
on how the TCP/IP environment is configured. This file is in

<title>DNS Lookup</title>

<para>
This capability is configured in the TCP/IP setup area in the network 
configuration facility. If enabled an elaborate name resolution sequence 
is followed the precise nature of which isdependant on what the NetBIOS 
Node Type parameter is configured to. A Node Type of 0 means use 
NetBIOS broadcast (over UDP broadcast) is first used if the name 
that is the subject of a name lookup is not found in the NetBIOS name 
cache. If that fails then DNS, HOSTS and LMHOSTS are checked. If set to 
Node Type 8, then a NetBIOS Unicast (over UDP Unicast) is sent to the 
WINS Server to obtain a lookup before DNS, HOSTS, LMHOSTS, or broadcast 
lookup is used.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>WINS Lookup</title>

<para>
A WINS (Windows Internet Name Server) service is the equivaent of the 
rfc1001/1002 specified NBNS (NetBIOS Name Server). A WINS server stores 
the names and IP addresses that are registered by a Windows client 
if the TCP/IP setup has been given at least one WINS Server IP Address.
</para>

<para>
To configure Samba to be a WINS server the following parameter needs 
to be added to the <filename>smb.conf</filename> file:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
	wins support = Yes
</programlisting></para>

<para>
To configure Samba to use a WINS server the following parameters are 
needed in the smb.conf file:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
	wins support = No
	wins server = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
</programlisting></para>

<para>
where <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable> is the IP address 
of the WINS server.
