<title>Migration from NT4 PDC to Samba-3 PDC</title>

<para>
This is a rough guide to assist those wishing to migrate from NT4 Domain Control to
Samba-3-based Domain Control.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>Planning and Getting Started</title>

<para>
In the IT world there is often a saying that all problems are encountered because of
poor planning. The corollary to this saying is that not all problems can be anticipated
and planned for. Then again, good planning will anticipate most show-stopper-type situations.
</para>

<para>
Those wishing to migrate from MS Windows NT4 Domain Control to a Samba-3 Domain Control
environment would do well to develop a detailed migration plan. So here are a few pointers to
help migration get under way.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Objectives</title>

<para>
The key objective for most organizations will be to make the migration from MS Windows NT4 
to Samba-3 Domain Control as painless as possible. One of the challenges you may experience
in your migration process may well be one of convincing management that the new environment
should remain in place. Many who have introduced open source technologies have experienced
pressure to return to a Microsoft-based platform solution at the first sign of trouble. 
</para>

<para>
Before attempting a migration to a Samba-3 controlled network, make every possible effort to
gain all-round commitment to the change. Know precisely <emphasis>why</emphasis> the change
is important for the organization. Possible motivations to make a change include:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>Improve network manageability.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Obtain better user level functionality.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Reduce network operating costs.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Reduce exposure caused by Microsoft withdrawal of NT4 support.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Avoid MS License 6 implications.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Reduce organization's dependency on Microsoft.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Make sure everyone knows that Samba-3 is not MS Windows NT4. Samba-3 offers
an alternative solution that is both different from MS Windows NT4 and offers 
advantages compared with it. Gain recognition that Samba-3 lacks many of the
features that Microsoft has promoted as core values in migration from MS Windows NT4 to 
MS Windows 2000 and beyond (with or without Active Directory services).

<para>
Before migrating a network from MS Windows NT4 to Samba-3, consider all necessary factors. Users
should be educated about changes they may experience so the change will be a welcome one
and not become an obstacle to the work they need to do. The following are factors that will 
help ensure a successful migration:
</para>

<sect3>
<title>Domain Layout</title>

<para>
Samba-3 can be configured as a Domain Controller, a back-up Domain Controller (probably best called
a secondary controller), a Domain Member, or as a stand-alone Server. The Windows network security
domain context should be sized and scoped before implementation. Particular attention needs to be
paid to the location of the primary Domain Controller (PDC) as well as backup controllers (BDCs).
One way in which Samba-3 differs from Microsoft technology is that if one chooses to use an LDAP
authentication backend, then the same database can be used by several different domains. In a
complex organization, there can be a single LDAP database, which itself can be distributed (have
a master server and multiple slave servers) that can simultaneously serve multiple domains.
</para>

<para>
>From a design perspective, the number of users per server as well as the number of servers per
domain should be scaled taking into consideration server capacity and network bandwidth.
</para>

<para>
A physical network segment may house several domains. Each may span multiple network segments.
Where domains span routed network segments, consider and test the performance implications of
the design and layout of a network. A centrally located Domain Controller that is designed to
serve multiple routed network segments may result in severe performance problems. Check the
response time (ping timing) between the remote segment and the PDC. If
it's long (more than 100 ms),
locate a backup controller (BDC) on the remote segment to serve as the local authentication and
access control server.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Server Share and Directory Layout</title>

<para>
There are cardinal rules to effective network design that cannot be broken with impunity.
The most important rule: Simplicity is king in every well-controlled network. Every part of
the infrastructure must be managed; the more complex it is, the greater will be the demand
of keeping systems secure and functional.
</para>

<para>
Keep in mind the nature of how data must be shared. Physical disk space layout should be considered
carefully. Some data must be backed up. The simpler the disk layout the easier it will be to
keep track of backup needs. Identify what backup media will meet your needs; consider backup to tape,
CD-ROM or (DVD-ROM), or other offline storage medium. Plan and implement for minimum
maintenance. Leave nothing to chance in your design; above all, do not leave backups to chance:
Backup, test, and validate every backup, create a disaster recovery plan and prove that it works.
</para>

<para>
Users should be grouped according to data access control needs. File and directory access 
is best controlled via group permissions and the use of the <quote>sticky bit</quote> on group controlled
directories may substantially avoid file access complaints from Samba share users.
</para>

<para>
Inexperienced  network administrators often attempt elaborate techniques to set access
controls on files, directories, shares, as well as in share definitions.
Keep your design and implementation simple and document your design extensively. Have others
audit your documentation. Do not create a complex mess that your successor will not understand.
Remember, job security through complex design and implementation may cause loss of operations
and downtime to users as the new administrator learns to untangle your knots. Keep access
controls simple and effective and make sure that users will never be interrupted by obtuse
complexity.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Logon Scripts</title>

<para>
Logon scripts can help to ensure that all users gain the share and printer connections they need.
</para>

<para>
Logon scripts can be created on-the-fly so all commands executed are specific to the
rights and privileges granted to the user. The preferred controls should be affected through
group membership so group information can be used to create a custom logon script using
the <smbconfoption><name>root preexec</name></smbconfoption> parameters to the <smbconfsection>NETLOGON</smbconfsection> share.
</para>

<para>
Some sites prefer to use a tool such as <command>kixstart</command> to establish a controlled
user environment. In any case, you may wish to do a Google search for logon script process controls.
In particular, you may wish to explore the use of the Microsoft KnowledgeBase article KB189105 that
deals with how to add printers without user intervention via the logon script process.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Profile Migration/Creation</title>

<para>
User and Group Profiles may be migrated using the tools described in the section titled Desktop Profile
Management.
</para>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>SID</primary></indexterm>
Profiles may also be managed using the Samba-3 tool <command>profiles</command>. This tool allows
the MS Windows NT-style security identifiers (SIDs) that are stored inside the profile <filename>NTuser.DAT</filename> file
to be changed to the SID of the Samba-3 domain.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>User and Group Accounts</title>

<para>
It is possible to migrate all account settings from an MS Windows NT4 domain to Samba-3. Before
attempting to migrate user and group accounts, it is STRONGLY advised to create in Samba-3 the
groups that are present on the MS Windows NT4 domain <emphasis>AND</emphasis> to map them to
suitable UNIX/Linux groups. By following this simple advice, all user and group attributes
should migrate painlessly.
</para>
</sect3>

<title>Steps in Migration Process</title>

<para>
The approximate migration process is described below.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
