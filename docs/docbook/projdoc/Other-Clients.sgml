<title>Samba and other CIFS clients</title>

<para>This chapter contains client-specific information.</para>

<sect1>
<title>Macintosh clients?</title>

<para>
Yes. <ulink url="http://www.thursby.com/">Thursby</ulink> now have a CIFS Client / Server called DAVE - see
</para>

<para>
They test it against Windows 95, Windows NT and samba for
compatibility issues.  At the time of writing, DAVE was at version
1.0.1. The 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 update is available as a free download from
the Thursby web site (the speed of finder copies has been greatly
enhanced, and there are bug-fixes included).
</para>

<para> 
Alternatives - There are two free implementations of AppleTalk for
several kinds of UNIX machnes, and several more commercial ones.
These products allow you to run file services and print services
natively to Macintosh users, with no additional support required on
the Macintosh.  The two free omplementations are 
<ulink url="http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/netatalk/">Netatalk</ulink>, and 
<ulink url="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/appletalk/atalk.html">CAP</ulink>.  
What Samba offers MS
Windows users, these packages offer to Macs.  For more info on these
packages, Samba, and Linux (and other UNIX-based systems) see

<title>OS2 Client</title>

	<sect2>
		<title>How can I configure OS/2 Warp Connect or 
		OS/2 Warp 4 as a client for Samba?</title>

		<para>A more complete answer to this question can be 
		found on <ulink url="http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/samba/warp.html">
		http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/samba/warp.html</ulink>.</para>
		
		<para>Basically, you need three components:</para>
		
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>The File and Print Client ('IBM Peer')
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>TCP/IP ('Internet support') 
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>The "NetBIOS over TCP/IP" driver ('TCPBEUI')
			</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		
		<para>Installing the first two together with the base operating 
		system on a blank system is explained in the Warp manual. If Warp 
		has already been installed, but you now want to install the 
		networking support, use the "Selective Install for Networking" 
		object in the "System Setup" folder.</para>

		<para>Adding the "NetBIOS over TCP/IP" driver is not described 
		in the manual and just barely in the online documentation. Start 
		MPTS.EXE, click on OK, click on "Configure LAPS" and click 
		on "IBM OS/2 NETBIOS OVER TCP/IP" in  'Protocols'.  This line 
		is then moved to 'Current Configuration'. Select that line, 
		click on "Change number" and increase it from 0 to 1. Save this
		configuration.</para>

		<para>If the Samba server(s) is not on your local subnet, you 
		can optionally add IP names and addresses of these servers 
		to the "Names List", or specify a  WINS server ('NetBIOS 
		Nameserver' in IBM and RFC terminology). For Warp Connect you 
		may need to download an update for 'IBM Peer' to bring it on 
		the same level as Warp 4. See the webpage mentioned above.</para>

		<title>How can I configure OS/2 Warp 3 (not Connect), 
		OS/2 1.2, 1.3 or 2.x for Samba?</title>
		
		<para>You can use the free Microsoft LAN Manager 2.2c Client 
		for OS/2 from 
		<ulink url="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/BusSys/Clients/LANMAN.OS2/">
		ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/BusSys/Clients/LANMAN.OS2/</ulink>.
   	See <ulink url="http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/lanman.html">
		http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/lanman.html</ulink> for 
		more information on how to install and use this client. In 
		a nutshell, edit the file \OS2VER in the root directory of 
		the OS/2 boot partition and add the lines:</para>
		
		<para><programlisting>
		20=setup.exe
		20=netwksta.sys
		20=netvdd.sys
		</programlisting></para>
		
		<para>before you install the client. Also, don't use the 
		included NE2000 driver because it is buggy. Try the NE2000 
		or NS2000 driver from 
		<ulink url="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/network/ndis/">
 		ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/network/ndis/</ulink> instead.
		</para>

		<title>Are there any other issues when OS/2 (any version) 
		is used as a client?</title>
		
		<para>When you do a NET VIEW or use the "File and Print 
		Client Resource Browser", no Samba servers show up. This can 
		be fixed by a patch from <ulink
		url="http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/samba/fix.html">
		http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/samba/fix.html</ulink>.
		The patch will be included in a later version of Samba. It also 
		fixes a couple of other problems, such as preserving long 
		filenames when objects are dragged from the Workplace Shell 
		to the Samba server. </para>

		<title>How do I get printer driver download working 
		for OS/2 clients?</title>

		<para>First, create a share called [PRINTDRV] that is 
		world-readable.  Copy your OS/2 driver files there.  Note 
		that the .EA_ files must still be separate, so you will need 
		to use the original install files, and not copy an installed 
		driver from an OS/2 system.</para>
		
		<para>Install the NT driver first for that printer.  Then, 
		add to your smb.conf a parameter, os2 driver map = 
		<replaceable>filename</replaceable>".  Then, in the file 
		specified by <replaceable>filename</replaceable>, map the 
		name of the NT driver name to the OS/2 driver name as 
		follows:</para>
		
		<para><command>nt driver name = os2 "driver 
		name"."device name"</command>, e.g.:
		HP LaserJet 5L = LASERJET.HP LaserJet 5L</para>

		<para>You can have multiple drivers mapped in this file.</para>
	
		<para>If you only specify the OS/2 driver name, and not the 
		device name, the first attempt to download the driver will 
		actually download the files, but the OS/2 client will tell 
		you the driver is not available.  On the second attempt, it 
		will work.  This is fixed simply by adding the device name
  		 to the mapping, after which it will work on the first attempt.

<title>Windows for Workgroups</title>

<sect2>
<title>Use latest TCP/IP stack from Microsoft</title>

<para>Use the latest TCP/IP stack from microsoft if you use Windows
for workgroups.</para>

<para>The early TCP/IP stacks had lots of bugs.</para>

<para> 
Microsoft has released an incremental upgrade to their TCP/IP 32-Bit
VxD drivers.  The latest release can be found on their ftp site at
ftp.microsoft.com, located in /peropsys/windows/public/tcpip/wfwt32.exe.
There is an update.txt file there that describes the problems that were
fixed.  New files include WINSOCK.DLL, TELNET.EXE, WSOCK.386, VNBT.386,
WSTCP.386, TRACERT.EXE, NETSTAT.EXE, and NBTSTAT.EXE.

<title>Delete .pwl files after password change</title>

<para>
WfWg does a lousy job with passwords. I find that if I change my
password on either the unix box or the PC the safest thing to do is to
delete the .pwl files in the windows directory. The PC will complain about not finding the files, but will soon get over it, allowing you to enter the new password.
</para>

<para> 
If you don't do this you may find that WfWg remembers and uses the old
password, even if you told it a new one.
</para>

<para> 
Often WfWg will totally ignore a password you give it in a dialog box.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Configure WfW password handling</title>

<para>
There is a program call admincfg.exe
on the last disk (disk 8) of the WFW 3.11 disk set.  To install it
type EXPAND A:\ADMINCFG.EX_ C:\WINDOWS\ADMINCFG.EXE Then add an icon
for it via the "Progam Manager" "New" Menu.  This program allows you
to control how WFW handles passwords.  ie disable Password Caching etc
for use with <command>security = user</command>
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Case handling of passwords</title>

<para>Windows for Workgroups uppercases the password before sending it to the server. Unix passwords can be case-sensitive though. Check the <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf(5)</ulink> information on <command>password level</command> to specify what characters samba should try to uppercase when checking.</para>

<title>Windows '95/'98</title>

<para>
When using Windows 95 OEM SR2 the following updates are recommended where Samba
is being used. Please NOTE that the above change will affect you once these
updates  have been installed.
</para>

<para> 
There are more updates than the ones mentioned here. You are referred to the
Microsoft Web site for all currently available updates to your specific version
of Windows 95.
</para>

<listitem><para>Redirector Update: VRDRUPD.EXE</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
Also, if using MS OutLook it is desirable to install the OLEUPD.EXE fix. This
fix may stop your machine from hanging for an extended period when exiting
OutLook and you may also notice a significant speedup when accessing network
neighborhood services.

<title>Windows 2000 Service Pack 2</title>

<para> 
There are several annoyances with Windows 2000 SP2. One of which
only appears when using a Samba server to host user profiles
to Windows 2000 SP2 clients in a Windows domain.  This assumes
that Samba is a member of the domain, but the problem will
likely occur if it is not.
</para>

<para> 
In order to server profiles successfully to Windows 2000 SP2 
clients (when not operating as a PDC), Samba must have 
<command>nt acl support = no</command>
added to the file share which houses the roaming profiles.
If this is not done, then the Windows 2000 SP2 client will
complain about not being able to access the profile (Access 
Denied) and create multiple copies of it on disk (DOMAIN.user.001,
DOMAIN.user.002, etc...).  See the 
<ulink url="smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf(5)</ulink> man page
for more details on this option.  Also note that the 
<command>nt acl support</command> parameter was formally a global parameter in
releases prior to Samba 2.2.2.
</para>

<para> 
The following is a minimal profile share:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
	[profile]
		path = /export/profile
		create mask = 0600
		directory mask = 0700
		nt acl support = no
		read only = no
</programlisting></para>

<para>
The reason for this bug is that the Win2k SP2 client copies
the security descriptor for the profile which contains
the Samba server's SID, and not the domain SID.  The client
compares the SID for SAMBA\user and realizes it is
different that the one assigned to DOMAIN\user.  Hence the reason
for the "access denied" message.
</para>

<para>
By disabling the <command>nt acl support</command> parameter, Samba will send
the Win2k client a response to the QuerySecurityDescriptor
trans2 call which causes the client to set a default ACL
for the profile. This default ACL includes 
</para>

<para><command>DOMAIN\user 	"Full Control"</command></para>

<para><emphasis>NOTE : This bug does not occur when using winbind to
create accounts on the Samba host for Domain users.</emphasis></para>
