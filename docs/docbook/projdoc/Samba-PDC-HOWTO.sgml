Version of Samba prior to release 2.2 had marginal capabilities to
act as a Windows NT 4.0 Primary Domain Controller (PDC).  Beginning with 
Samba 2.2.0, we are proud to announce official support for Windows NT 4.0 
style domain logons from Windows NT 4.0 (through SP6) and Windows 2000 (through 
SP1) clients.  This article outlines the steps necessary for configuring Samba 
as a PDC.  It is necessary to have a working Samba server prior to implementing the 
PDC functionality.  If you have not followed the steps outlined in 
<ulink url="UNIX_INSTALL.html"> UNIX_INSTALL.html</ulink>, please make sure 
that your server is configured correctly before proceeding.  Another good 
resource in the <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf(5) man 
page</ulink>. The following  functionality should work in 2.2:

     Configuring the Samba PDC

*************************************************************** -->

<sect1>
<title>Configuring the Samba Domain Controller</title>

<para>
The first step in creating a working Samba PDC is to 
understand the parameters necessary in smb.conf.  I will not
attempt to re-explain the parameters here as they are more that
adequately covered in <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html"> the smb.conf
man page</ulink>.  For convenience, the parameters have been
linked with the actual smb.conf description.
</para>

<para>
Here is an example smb.conf for acting as a PDC:
</para>

</programlisting></para>

<para>
There are a couple of points to emphasize in the above configuration.
</para>

	</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>    

<para>
As Samba 2.2 does not offer a complete implementation of group mapping between 
Windows NT groups and UNIX groups (this is really quite complicated to explain 
in a short space), you should refer to the <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#DOMAINADMINUSERS">domain 
admin users</ulink> and <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#DOMAINADMINGROUP">domain 
admin group</ulink> smb.conf parameters for information of creating a Domain Admins 
style accounts.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Creating Machine Trust Accounts and Joining Clients 
to the Domain</title>

<para>
A machine trust account is a samba user account owned by a computer.  
The account password acts as the shared secret for secure 
communication with the Domain Controller.  This is a security feature
to prevent an unauthorized machine with the same netbios name from 
joining the domain and gaining access to domain user/group accounts.  
Hence a Windows 9x host is never a true member of a domain because it does 
not posses a machine trust account, and thus has no shared secret with the DC.
</para>

<para>
On a Windows NT PDC, these machine trust account passwords are stored
in the registry.  A Samba PDC stores these accounts in the same location
as user LanMan and NT password hashes (currently <filename>smbpasswd</filename>).
However, machine trust accounts only possess and use the NT password hash.
</para>

<para>
Because Samba requires machine accounts to possess a UNIX uid from
which an Windows NT SID can be generated, all of these accounts
must have an entry in <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and smbpasswd.  
Future releases will alleviate the need to create 
<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entries.  
</para>

<para>
There are two means of creating machine trust accounts.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	Manual creation before joining the client to the domain.  In this case, 
	the password is set to a known value -- the lower case of the 
	machine's netbios name.
	</para></listitem>
	
	<listitem><para>
	Creation of the account at the time of joining the domain.  In 
	this case, the session key of the administrative account used to join 
	the client to the domain acts as an encryption key for setting the 
	password to a random value (This is the recommended method).
	</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<sect2>
<title>Manually creating machine trust accounts</title>

<para>
The first step in creating a machine trust account by hand is to 
create an entry for the machine in /etc/passwd.  This can be done 
using <command>vipw</command> or any 'add userr' command which is normally 
used to create new UNIX accounts.  The following is an example for a Linux 
based Samba server:
</para>

<para>
<prompt>root# </prompt>/usr/sbin/useradd -g 100 -d /dev/null -c <replaceable>
machine_nickname</replaceable> -m -s /bin/false <replaceable>machine_name</replaceable>$
</para>

<para>
The <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entry will list the machine name 
with a $ appended, won't have a passwd, will have a null shell and no 
home directory. For example a machine called 'doppy' would have an 
<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entry like this :
</para>

<para><programlisting>
doppy$:x:505:501:<replaceable>machine_nickname</replaceable>:/dev/null:/bin/false
</programlisting></para>

<para>
Above, <replaceable>machine_nickname</replaceable> can be any descriptive name for the
pc i.e. BasementComputer. The <replaceable>machine_name</replaceable> absolutely must be 
the netbios name of the pc to be added to the domain.  The "$" must append the netbios
name of the pc or samba will not recognize this as a machine account
</para>


<para>
Now that the UNIX account has been created, the next step is to create 
the smbpasswd entry for the machine containing the well known initial 
trust account password.  This can be done using the <ulink 
url="smbpasswd.6.html"><command>smbpasswd(8)</command></ulink> command 
as shown here:
</para>

<para>
<prompt>root# </prompt> smbpasswd -a -m <replaceable>machine_name</replaceable>
</para>

<para>
where <replaceable>machine_name</replaceable> is the machine's netbios
name. 
</para>

<warning>
	<title>Join the client to the domain immediately</title>

	<para>
	Manually creating a machine trust account using this method is the 
	equivalent of creating a machine account on a Windows NT PDC using 
	the "Server Manager".  From the time at which the account is created
	to the time which th client joins the domain and changes the password,
	your domain is vulnerable to an intruder joining your domain using a
	a machine with the same netbios name.  A PDC inherently trusts
	members of the domain and will serve out a large degree of user 
	information to such clients.  You have been warned!
	</para>
</warning>
</sect2>


<sect2>
<title>Creating machine trust accounts "on the fly"</title>

<para>
The second, and most recommended way of creating machine trust accounts 
is to create them as needed at the time the client is joined to 
the domain.  You will need to include a value for the <ulink 
url="smb.conf.5.html#ADDUSERSCRIPT">add user script</ulink>
parameter.  Below is an example from a RedHat 6.2 Linux system.
</para>

<para><programlisting>
add user script = /usr/sbin/useradd -d /dev/null -g 100 -s /bin/false -M %u 
</programlisting></para>

<para>
In Samba 2.2.1, <emphasis>only the root account</emphasis> can be used to create
machine accounts like this.  Therefore, it is required to create 
an entry in smbpasswd for <emphasis>root</emphasis>.  The password 
<emphasis>SHOULD</emphasis> be set to s different password that the 
associated <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entry for security reasons.
</para>

<para>
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
	<para>
	<emphasis>I cannot include a '$' in a machine name.</emphasis>
	</para>
    
	<para>
	A 'machine name' in (typically) <filename>/etc/passwd</> 	
	of the machine name with a '$' appended. FreeBSD (and other BSD 
	systems ?) won't create a user with a '$' in their name.
	</para>

	<para>
	The problem is only in the program used to make the entry, once 
	made, it works perfectly. So create a user without the '$' and 
	use <command>vipw</> to edit the entry, adding the '$'. Or create 
	the whole entry with vipw if you like, make sure you use a 
	unique uid !
	</para>
</listitem>
  
<listitem>
	<para>
	<emphasis>I get told "You already have a connection to the Domain...." 
	or "Cannot join domain, the credentials supplied conflict with an 
	existing set.." when creating a machine account.</emphasis>
	</para>

	<para>
	This happens if you try to create a machine account from the 
	machine itself and already have a connection (e.g. mapped drive) 
	to a share (or IPC$) on the Samba PDC.  The following command
	will remove all network drive connections:
	</para>

	<para>
	<prompt>C:\WINNT\></prompt> <command>net use * /d</command>
	</para>

	<para>
	Further, if the machine is a already a 'member of a workgroup' that 
	is the same name as the domain you are joining (bad idea) you will 
	get this message.  Change the workgroup name to something else, it 
	does not matter what, reboot, and try again.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	<emphasis>The system can not log you on (C000019B)....</emphasis>
	</para>

	<para>I joined the domain successfully but after upgrading 
	to a newer version of the Samba code I get the message, "The system 
	can not log you on (C000019B), Please try a gain or consult your 
	system administrator" when attempting to logon.
	</para>

	<para>
	This occurs when the domain SID stored in 
	<filename>private/WORKGROUP.SID</filename> is 
	changed.  For example, you remove the file and <command>smbd</command> automatically 
	creates a new one.  Or you are swapping back and forth between 
	versions 2.0.7, TNG and the HEAD branch code (not recommended).  The 
	only way to correct the problem is to restore the original domain 
	SID or remove the domain client from the domain and rejoin.

	<para>
	<emphasis>The machine account for this computer either does not

	</para>

	<para>
	When I try to join the domain I get the message "The machine account 
	for this computer either does not exist or is not accessible". Whats 
	wrong?
	</para>

	<para>
	This problem is caused by the PDC not having a suitable machine account. 
	If you are using the <parameter>add user script</parameter> method to create 
	accounts then this would indicate that it has not worked. Ensure the domain 
	admin user system is working.
	</para>

	<para>
	Alternatively if you are creating account entries manually then they 
	have not been created correctly. Make sure that you have the entry 
	correct for the machine account in smbpasswd file on the Samba PDC. 
	If you added the account using an editor rather than using the smbpasswd 
	utility, make sure that the account name is the machine netbios name 
	with a '$' appended to it ( ie. computer_name$ ). There must be an entry 
	in both /etc/passwd and the smbpasswd file. Some people have reported 
	that inconsistent subnet masks between the Samba server and the NT 
	client have caused this problem.   Make sure that these are consistent 
	for both client and server.

	<emphasis>When I attempt to login to a Samba Domain from a NT4/W2K workstation,

	This problem is caused by a PAM related bug in Samba 2.2.0.  This bug is 
	fixed in 2.2.1.  Other symptoms could be unaccessible shares on

     Getting Help

*************************************************************** -->


<sect1>
<title>What other help can I get ? </title>

<para>
There are many sources of information available in the form 
of mailing lists, RFC's and documentation.  The docs that come 
with the samba distribution contain very good explanations of 
general SMB topics such as browsing.</para> 

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
	<para>
	<emphasis>What are some diagnostics tools I can use to debug the domain logon 
	process and where can I	find them?</emphasis>
	</para>

   <para>
	One of the best diagnostic tools for debugging problems is Samba itself.  
	You can use the -d option for both smbd and nmbd to specifiy what 
	'debug level' at which to run.  See the man pages on smbd, nmbd  and 
	smb.conf for more information on debugging options.  The debug 
	level can range from 1 (the default) to 10 (100 for debugging passwords).
	</para>
	
	<para>
	Another helpful method of debugging is to compile samba using the 
	<command>gcc -g </command> flag.   This will include debug 
	information in the binaries and allow you to attach gdb to the 
	running smbd / nmbd process.  In order to attach gdb to an smbd 
	process for an NT workstation, first get the workstation to make the 
	connection. Pressing ctrl-alt-delete and going down to the domain box 
	is sufficient (at least, on the first time you join the domain) to 
	generate a 'LsaEnumTrustedDomains'. Thereafter, the workstation 
	maintains an open connection, and therefore there will be an smbd 
	process running (assuming that you haven't set a really short smbd 
	idle timeout)  So, in between pressing ctrl alt delete, and actually 
	typing in your password, you can gdb attach and continue.

	For tracing things on the Microsoft Windows NT, Network Monitor 
	(aka. netmon) is available on the Microsoft Developer Network CD's, 
	the Windows NT Server install CD and the SMS CD's.  The version of 
	netmon that ships with SMS allows for dumping packets between any two 
	computers (ie. placing the network interface in promiscuous mode).  
	The version on the NT Server install CD will only allow monitoring 
	of network traffic directed to the local NT box and broadcasts on the 
	local subnet.  Be aware that Ethereal can read and write netmon 
	formatted files.

	<para>
	Installing netmon on an NT workstation requires a couple 
	of steps.  The following are for installing Netmon V4.00.349, which comes 
	with Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, on Microsoft Windows NT 
	Workstation 4.0.  The process should be similar for other version of 
	Windows NT / Netmon.  You will need both the Microsoft Windows 
	NT Server 4.0 Install CD and the Workstation 4.0 Install CD.
	</para> 

	<para>
	Initially you will need to install 'Network Monitor Tools and Agent'

<title>
DOMAIN_CONTROL.txt : Windows NT Domain Control & Samba
</title>

<warning>
	<title>Possibly Outdated Material</title>

	<para>
	This appendix was originally authored by John H Terpstra of 
	the Samba Team and is included here for posterity.
	</para>
</warning>


<para>
<emphasis>NOTE :</emphasis> 
The term "Domain Controller" and those related to it refer to one specific
method of authentication that can underly an SMB domain. Domain Controllers
prior to Windows NT Server 3.1 were sold by various companies and based on 
private extensions to the LAN Manager 2.1 protocol. Windows NT introduced
Microsoft-specific ways of distributing the user authentication database.
See DOMAIN.txt for examples of how Samba can participate in or create
SMB domains based on shared authentication database schemes other than the 
Windows NT SAM.
</para>

<para>
Windows NT Server can be installed as either a plain file and print server
(WORKGROUP workstation or server) or as a server that participates in Domain
Control (DOMAIN member, Primary Domain controller or Backup Domain controller).
The same is true for OS/2 Warp Server, Digital Pathworks and other similar
products, all of which can participate in Domain Control along with Windows NT.
</para>

<para>
To many people these terms can be confusing, so let's try to clear the air.
</para>

<para>
Every Windows NT system (workstation or server) has a registry database.
The registry contains entries that describe the initialization information
for all services (the equivalent of Unix Daemons) that run within the Windows
NT environment. The registry also contains entries that tell application
software where to find dynamically loadable libraries that they depend upon.
In fact, the registry contains entries that describes everything that anything
may need to know to interact with the rest of the system.
</para>

<para>
The registry files can be located on any Windows NT machine by opening a
command prompt and typing:
</para>

<para>
<prompt>C:\WINNT\></prompt> dir %SystemRoot%\System32\config
</para>

<para>
The environment variable %SystemRoot% value can be obtained by typing:
</para>

<para>
<prompt>C:\WINNT></prompt>echo %SystemRoot%
</para>

<para>
The active parts of the registry that you may want to be familiar with are
the files called: default, system, software, sam and security.
</para>

<para>
In a domain environment, Microsoft Windows NT domain controllers participate
in replication of the SAM and SECURITY files so that all controllers within
the domain have an exactly identical copy of each.
</para>

<para>
The Microsoft Windows NT system is structured within a security model that
says that all applications and services must authenticate themselves before
they can obtain permission from the security manager to do what they set out
to do.
</para>

<para>
The Windows NT User database also resides within the registry. This part of
the registry contains the user's security identifier, home directory, group
memberships, desktop profile, and so on.
</para>

<para>
Every Windows NT system (workstation as well as server) will have its own
registry. Windows NT Servers that participate in Domain Security control
have a database that they share in common - thus they do NOT own an
independent full registry database of their own, as do Workstations and
plain Servers.
</para>

<para>
The User database is called the SAM (Security Access Manager) database and
is used for all user authentication as well as for authentication of inter-
process authentication (ie: to ensure that the service action a user has
requested is permitted within the limits of that user's privileges).
</para>

<para>
The Samba team have produced a utility that can dump the Windows NT SAM into 
smbpasswd format: see ENCRYPTION.txt for information on smbpasswd and
/pub/samba/pwdump on your nearest Samba mirror for the utility. This 
facility is useful but cannot be easily used to implement SAM replication
to Samba systems.
</para>

<para>
Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT Workstations and Servers
can participate in a Domain security system that is controlled by Windows NT
servers that have been correctly configured. At most every domain will have
ONE Primary Domain Controller (PDC). It is desirable that each domain will
have at least one Backup Domain Controller (BDC).
</para>

<para>
The PDC and BDCs then participate in replication of the SAM database so that
each Domain Controlling participant will have an up to date SAM component
within its registry.
</para>
