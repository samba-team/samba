<title>User information database</title>

<sect1>
	<title>Introduction</title>

	<para>Old windows clients send plain text passwords over the wire. 
	Samba can check these passwords by crypting them and comparing them 
	to the hash stored in the unix user database.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	Newer windows clients send encrypted passwords (so-called 
	Lanman and NT hashes) over 
	the wire, instead of plain text passwords. The newest clients 
	will only send encrypted passwords and refuse to send plain text 
	passwords, unless their registry is tweaked.
	</para>

	<para>These passwords can't be converted to unix style encrypted 
	passwords. Because of that you can't use the standard unix 
	user database, and you have to store the Lanman and NT hashes 
	somewhere else. </para>
	
	<para>Next to a differently encrypted passwords, 
	windows also stores certain data for each user 
	that is not stored in a unix user database, e.g. 
	workstations the user may logon from, the location where his/her 
	profile is stored, etc.
	Samba retrieves and stores this information using a "passdb backend".
	Commonly
	available backends are LDAP, plain text file, MySQL and nisplus.
	For more information, see the documentation about the 
	<command>passdb backend = </command> parameter.

	<title>Important Notes About Security</title>
	
	<para>The unix and SMB password encryption techniques seem similar 
	on the surface. This similarity is, however, only skin deep. The unix 
	scheme typically sends clear text passwords over the network when 
	logging in. This is bad. The SMB encryption scheme never sends the 
	cleartext password over the network but it does store the 16 byte 
	hashed values on disk. This is also bad. Why? Because the 16 byte hashed 
	values are a "password equivalent". You cannot derive the user's 
	password from them, but they could potentially be used in a modified 
	client to gain access to a server. This would require considerable 
	technical knowledge on behalf of the attacker but is perfectly possible. 
	You should thus treat the data stored in whatever 
	passdb backend you use (smbpasswd file, ldap, mysql) as though it contained the 
	cleartext passwords of all your users. Its contents must be kept 
	secret, and the file should be protected accordingly.</para>
	
	<para>Ideally we would like a password scheme which neither requires 
	plain text passwords on the net or on disk. Unfortunately this 
	is not available as Samba is stuck with being compatible with 
	other SMB systems (WinNT, WfWg, Win95 etc). </para>

	<warning>
		<para>Note that Windows NT 4.0 Service pack 3 changed the 
		default for permissible authentication so that plaintext 
		passwords are <emphasis>never</emphasis> sent over the wire. 
		The solution to this is either to switch to encrypted passwords 
		with Samba or edit the Windows NT registry to re-enable plaintext 
		passwords. See the document WinNT.txt for details on how to do 
		this.</para>
		
		<para>Other Microsoft operating systems which also exhibit 
		this behavior includes</para>

		security protocols, although they may log onto a domain environment.

		clear text authentication does not disable the ability
		of the client to participate in encrypted authentication.</para>


		<para>MS Windows clients will cache the encrypted password alone.
		Even when plain text passwords are re-enabled, through the appropriate
		registry change, the plain text password is NEVER cached. This means that
		in the event that a network connections should become disconnected (broken)
		only the cached (encrypted) password will be sent to the resource server
		to affect a auto-reconnect. If the resource server does not support encrypted
		passwords the auto-reconnect will fail. <emphasis>USE OF ENCRYPTED PASSWORDS
		IS STRONGLY ADVISED.</emphasis></para>

	<title>The smbpasswd Command</title>
	
	<para>The smbpasswd utility is a utility similar to the 
	<command>passwd</command> or <command>yppasswd</command> programs.
	It maintains the two 32 byte password fields in the passdb backend. </para>

	<para><command>smbpasswd</command> works in a client-server mode 
	where it contacts the local smbd to change the user's password on its 
	behalf. This has enormous benefits - as follows.</para>

	<para><command>smbpasswd</command> has the capability 
	to change passwords on Windows NT servers (this only works when 
	the request is sent to the NT Primary Domain Controller if you 
	are changing an NT Domain user's password).</para>

	<para><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>smbpasswd</userinput></para>
	<para><prompt>Old SMB password: </prompt><userinput>&lt;type old value here - 
	or hit return if there was no old password&gt;</userinput></para>

	</userinput></para>
	<para><prompt>Repeat New SMB Password: </prompt><userinput>&lt;re-type new value

	<para>If the old value does not match the current value stored for 
	that user, or the two new values do not match each other, then the 
	password will not be changed.</para>
	
	<para>If invoked by an ordinary user it will only allow the user 
	to change his or her own Samba password.</para>
	
	<para>If run by the root user smbpasswd may take an optional 
	argument, specifying the user name whose SMB password you wish to 
	change.  Note that when run as root smbpasswd does not prompt for 
	or check the old password value, thus allowing root to set passwords 
	for users who have forgotten their passwords.</para>
	
	<para><command>smbpasswd</command> is designed to work in the same way 
	and be familiar to UNIX users who use the <command>passwd</command> or

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
Traditionally, when configuring <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#ENCRYPTPASSWORDS">"encrypt
passwords = yes"</ulink> in Samba's <filename>smb.conf</filename> file, user account
information such as username, LM/NT password hashes, password change times, and account
flags have been stored in the <filename>smbpasswd(5)</filename> file.  There are several
disadvantages to this approach for sites with very large numbers of users (counted
in the thousands).
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
The first is that all lookups must be performed sequentially.  Given that
there are approximately two lookups per domain logon (one for a normal
session connection such as when mapping a network drive or printer), this
is a performance bottleneck for lareg sites.  What is needed is an indexed approach
such as is used in databases.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The second problem is that administrators who desired to replicate a
smbpasswd file to more than one Samba server were left to use external
tools such as <command>rsync(1)</command> and <command>ssh(1)</command>
and wrote custom, in-house scripts.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
And finally, the amount of information which is stored in an
smbpasswd entry leaves no room for additional attributes such as
a home directory, password expiration time, or even a Relative
Identified (RID).
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
As a result of these defeciencies, a more robust means of storing user attributes
used by smbd was developed.  The API which defines access to user accounts
is commonly referred to as the samdb interface (previously this was called the passdb
API, and is still so named in the CVS trees). In Samba 2.2.3, enabling support
for a samdb backend (e.g. <parameter>--with-ldapsam</parameter> or
<parameter>--with-tdbsam</parameter>) requires compile time support.
</para>

<para>
When compiling Samba to include the <parameter>--with-ldapsam</parameter> autoconf
option, smbd (and associated tools) will store and lookup user accounts in
an LDAP directory.  In reality, this is very easy to understand.  If you are
comfortable with using an smbpasswd file, simply replace "smbpasswd" with
"LDAP directory" in all the documentation.
</para>

<para>
There are a few points to stress about what the <parameter>--with-ldapsam</parameter>
does not provide.  The LDAP support referred to in the this documentation does not
include:

	an Windows 2000 Active Directory server.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>A means of replacing /etc/passwd.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The second item can be accomplished by using LDAP NSS and PAM modules.  LGPL
versions of these libraries can be obtained from PADL Software
(<ulink url="http://www.padl.com/">http://www.padl.com/</ulink>).  However,
the details of configuring these packages are beyond the scope of this document.

<title>Supported LDAP Servers</title>

<para>
The LDAP samdb code in 2.2.3 (and later) has been developed and tested
using the OpenLDAP 2.0 server and client libraries. 
The same code should be able to work with Netscape's Directory Server
and client SDK. However, due to lack of testing so far, there are bound
to be compile errors and bugs.  These should not be hard to fix.

<title>Schema and Relationship to the RFC 2307 posixAccount</title>


<para>
Samba 3.0 includes the necessary schema file for OpenLDAP 2.0 in
<filename>examples/LDAP/samba.schema</filename>.  The sambaAccount objectclass is given here:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
objectclass ( 1.3.1.5.1.4.1.7165.2.2.2 NAME 'sambaAccount' SUP top STRUCTURAL
     DESC 'Samba Account'
     MUST ( uid $ rid )
     MAY  ( cn $ lmPassword $ ntPassword $ pwdLastSet $ logonTime $
            logoffTime $ kickoffTime $ pwdCanChange $ pwdMustChange $ acctFlags $
            displayName $ smbHome $ homeDrive $ scriptPath $ profilePath $
            description $ userWorkstations $ primaryGroupID $ domain ))
</programlisting></para>

<para>
The samba.schema file has been formatted for OpenLDAP 2.0.  The OID's are
owned by the Samba Team and as such is legal to be openly published.
If you translate the schema to be used with Netscape DS, please
submit the modified schema file as a patch to <ulink
url="jerry@samba.org">jerry@samba.org</ulink>
</para>

<para>
Just as the smbpasswd file is mean to store information which supplements a
user's <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entry, so is the sambaAccount object
meant to supplement the UNIX user account information.  A sambaAccount is a
<constant>STRUCTURAL</constant> objectclass so it can be stored individually
in the directory.  However, there are several fields (e.g. uid) which overlap
with the posixAccount objectclass outlined in RFC2307.  This is by design.
</para>

<!--olem: we should perhaps have a note about shadowAccounts too as many
systems use them, isn'it ? -->

<para>
In order to store all user account information (UNIX and Samba) in the directory,
it is necessary to use the sambaAccount and posixAccount objectclasses in
combination.  However, smbd will still obtain the user's UNIX account
information via the standard C library calls (e.g. getpwnam(), et. al.).
This means that the Samba server must also have the LDAP NSS library installed
and functioning correctly.  This division of information makes it possible to
store all Samba account information in LDAP, but still maintain UNIX account
information in NIS while the network is transitioning to a full LDAP infrastructure.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Configuring Samba with LDAP</title>


<sect3>
<title>OpenLDAP configuration</title>

<para>
To include support for the sambaAccount object in an OpenLDAP directory
server, first copy the samba.schema file to slapd's configuration directory.
</para>

<para>
<prompt>root# </prompt><command>cp samba.schema /etc/openldap/schema/</command>
</para>

<para>
Next, include the <filename>samba.schema</filename> file in <filename>slapd.conf</filename>.
The sambaAccount object contains two attributes which depend upon other schema
files.  The 'uid' attribute is defined in <filename>cosine.schema</filename> and
the 'displayName' attribute is defined in the <filename>inetorgperson.schema</filename>
file.  Both of these must be included before the <filename>samba.schema</filename> file.
</para>

<para><programlisting>
## /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

## schema files (core.schema is required by default)
include	           /etc/openldap/schema/core.schema

## needed for sambaAccount
include            /etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
include            /etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
include            /etc/openldap/schema/samba.schema

## uncomment this line if you want to support the RFC2307 (NIS) schema
## include         /etc/openldap/schema/nis.schema

....
</programlisting></para>

<para>
It is recommended that you maintain some indices on some of the most usefull attributes,
like in the following example, to speed up searches made on sambaAccount objectclasses
(and possibly posixAccount and posixGroup as well).
</para>
<para><programlisting>
# Indices to maintain
## required by OpenLDAP 2.0
index objectclass   eq

## support pb_getsampwnam()
index uid           pres,eq
## support pdb_getsambapwrid()
index rid           eq

## uncomment these if you are storing posixAccount and
## posixGroup entries in the directory as well
##index uidNumber     eq
##index gidNumber     eq
##index cn            eq
##index memberUid     eq

<title>Accounts and Groups management</title>

<para>
As users accounts are managed thru the sambaAccount objectclass, you should
modify you existing administration tools to deal with sambaAccount attributes.
</para>

<para>
Machines accounts are managed with the sambaAccount objectclass, just
like users accounts. However, it's up to you to stored thoses accounts
in a different tree of you LDAP namespace: you should use
"ou=Groups,dc=plainjoe,dc=org" to store groups and
"ou=People,dc=plainjoe,dc=org" to store users. Just configure your
NSS and PAM accordingly (usually, in the /etc/ldap.conf configuration
file).
</para>

<para>
In Samba release 3.0, the group management system is based on posix
groups. This means that Samba make usage of the posixGroup objectclass.
For now, there is no NT-like group system management (global and local
groups).
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Security and sambaAccount</title>


<para>
There are two important points to remember when discussing the security
of sambaAccount entries in the directory.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><emphasis>Never</emphasis> retrieve the lmPassword or
	ntPassword attribute values over an unencrypted LDAP session.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><emphasis>Never</emphasis> allow non-admin users to
	view the lmPassword or ntPassword attribute values.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
These password hashes are clear text equivalents and can be used to impersonate
the user without deriving the original clear text strings.  For more information
on the details of LM/NT password hashes, refer to the <ulink
url="ENCRYPTION.html">ENCRYPTION chapter</ulink> of the Samba-HOWTO-Collection.
</para>

<para>
To remedy the first security issue, the "ldap ssl" smb.conf parameter defaults
to require an encrypted session (<command>ldap ssl = on</command>) using
the default port of 636
when contacting the directory server.  When using an OpenLDAP 2.0 server, it
is possible to use the use the StartTLS LDAP extended  operation in the place of
LDAPS.  In either case, you are strongly discouraged to disable this security
(<command>ldap ssl = off</command>).
</para>

<para>
Note that the LDAPS protocol is deprecated in favor of the LDAPv3 StartTLS
extended operation.  However, the OpenLDAP library still provides support for
the older method of securing communication between clients and servers.
</para>

<para>
The second security precaution is to prevent non-administrative users from
harvesting password hashes from the directory.  This can be done using the
following ACL in <filename>slapd.conf</filename>:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
## allow the "ldap admin dn" access, but deny everyone else
access to attrs=lmPassword,ntPassword
     by dn="cn=Samba Admin,ou=people,dc=plainjoe,dc=org" write
     by * none
</programlisting></para>

<para>
The majority of these parameters are only used when Samba is acting as a PDC of
a domain (refer to the <ulink url="Samba-PDC-HOWTO.html">Samba-PDC-HOWTO</ulink> for details on
how to configure Samba as a Primary Domain Controller). The following four attributes
are only stored with the sambaAccount entry if the values are non-default values:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>smbHome</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>scriptPath</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>logonPath</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>homeDrive</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
These attributes are only stored with the sambaAccount entry if
the values are non-default values.  For example, assume TASHTEGO has now been
configured as a PDC and that <command>logon home = \\%L\%u</command> was defined in
its <filename>smb.conf</filename> file. When a user named "becky" logons to the domain,
the <parameter>logon home</parameter> string is expanded to \\TASHTEGO\becky.
If the smbHome attribute exists in the entry "uid=becky,ou=people,dc=samba,dc=org",
this value is used.  However, if this attribute does not exist, then the value
of the <parameter>logon home</parameter> parameter is used in its place.  Samba
will only write the attribute value to the directory entry is the value is
something other than the default (e.g. \\MOBY\becky).

<para>To build the plugin, run <command>make bin/pdb_mysql.so</command>
in the <filename>source/</filename> directory of samba distribution. 
</para>

<para>Next, copy pdb_mysql.so to any location you want. I 
strongly recommend installing it in $PREFIX/lib or /usr/lib/samba/</para>

<title>Creating the database</title>

<para>
You either can set up your own table and specify the field names to pdb_mysql (see below
for the column names) or use the default table. The file <filename>examples/pdb/mysql/mysql.dump</filename> 
contains the correct queries to create the required tables. Use the command :

<command>mysql -u<replaceable>username</replaceable> -h<replaceable>hostname</replaceable> -p<replaceable>password</replaceable> <replaceable>databasename</replaceable> < <filename>/path/to/samba/examples/pdb/mysql/mysql.dump</filename></command>

<title>Configuring</title>

<para>This plugin lacks some good documentation, but here is some short info:</para>

<para>Add a the following to the <command>passdb backend</command> variable in your <filename>smb.conf</filename>:
<programlisting>
passdb backend = [other-plugins] plugin:/location/to/pdb_mysql.so:identifier [other-plugins]
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>The identifier can be any string you like, as long as it doesn't collide with 
the identifiers of other plugins or other instances of pdb_mysql. If you 
specify multiple pdb_mysql.so entries in 'passdb backend', you also need to 
use different identifiers!
</para>

<para>
Additional options can be given thru the smb.conf file in the [global] section.
</para>

<para><programlisting>
identifier:mysql host                     - host name, defaults to 'localhost'
identifier:mysql password
identifier:mysql user                     - defaults to 'samba'
identifier:mysql database                 - defaults to 'samba'
identifier:mysql port                     - defaults to 3306
identifier:table                          - Name of the table containing users
</programlisting></para>

<warning>
<para>
Since the password for the mysql user is stored in the 
smb.conf file, you should make the the smb.conf file 
readable only to the user that runs samba. This is considered a security 
bug and will be fixed soon.
</para>

<para>
Eventually, you can put a colon (:) after the name of each column, which 
should specify the column to update when updating the table. You can also
specify nothing behind the colon - then the data from the field will not be 
updated.

<title>Using plaintext passwords or encrypted password</title>

<para>
I strongly discourage the use of plaintext passwords, however, you can use them:
</para>

<para>
If you would like to use plaintext passwords, set 'identifier:lanman pass column' and 'identifier:nt pass column' to 'NULL' (without the quotes) and 'identifier:plain pass column' to the name of the column containing the plaintext passwords. 
</para>

<para>
If you use encrypted passwords, set the 'identifier:plain pass column' to 'NULL' (without the quotes). This is the default.

<title>Getting non-column data from the table</title>

<para>
It is possible to have not all data in the database and making some 'constant'.
</para>

<para>
For example, you can set 'identifier:fullname column' to : 
<command>CONCAT(First_name,' ',Sur_name)</command>
</para>

<para>
Or, set 'identifier:workstations column' to :
<command>NULL</command></para>

<para>The usage of pdb_xml is pretty straightforward. To export data, use:

<command>pdbedit -e plugin:/usr/lib/samba/pdb_xml.so:filename</command>

(where filename is the name of the file to put the data in)
</para>

<para>
To import data, use:
<command>pdbedit -i plugin:/usr/lib/samba/pdb_xml.so:filename -e current-pdb</command>

Where filename is the name to read the data from and current-pdb to put it in.
