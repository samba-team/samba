<listitem>
	<para>This is a boolean that controls the handling of 
	file locking in the server. When this is set to <constant>yes</constant> 
	the server will check every read and write access for file locks, and 
	deny access if locks exist. This can be slow on some systems.</para>

	<para>When strict locking is <constant>no</constant> the server does file 
	lock checks only when the client explicitly asks for them.</para>

	<para>Well-behaved clients always ask for lock checks when it 
	is important, so in the vast majority of cases <command moreinfo="none">strict 
	locking = no</command> is preferable.</para>

	<para>Default: <command moreinfo="none">strict locking = no</command></para>
