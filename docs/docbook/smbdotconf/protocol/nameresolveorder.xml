		<listitem><para>This option is used by the programs in the Samba 
		suite to determine what naming services to use and in what order 
		to resolve host names to IP addresses. The option takes a space 
		separated string of name resolution options.</para>

		<para>The options are :&quot;lmhosts&quot;, &quot;host&quot;, &quot;wins&quot; and &quot;bcast&quot;. They 
		cause names to be resolved as follows :</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para><constant>lmhosts</constant> : Lookup an IP 
			address in the Samba lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has 
			no name type attached to the NetBIOS name (see the <ulink url="lmhosts.5.html">lmhosts(5)</ulink> for details) then
			any name type matches for lookup.</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para><constant>host</constant> : Do a standard host 
			name to IP address resolution, using the system <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/hosts
			</filename>, NIS, or DNS lookups. This method of name resolution 
			is operating system depended for instance on IRIX or Solaris this 
			may be controlled by the <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename> 
			file.  Note that this method is only used if the NetBIOS name 
			type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise 
			it is ignored.</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para><constant>wins</constant> : Query a name with 
			the IP address listed in the <link linkend="WINSSERVER"><parameter moreinfo="none">
			wins server</parameter></link> parameter.  If no WINS server has
			been specified this method will be ignored.</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para><constant>bcast</constant> : Do a broadcast on 
			each of the known local interfaces listed in the <link linkend="INTERFACES"><parameter moreinfo="none">interfaces</parameter></link> 
			parameter. This is the least reliable of the name resolution 
			methods as it depends on the target host being on a locally 
			connected subnet.</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>Default: <command moreinfo="none">name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast
		</command></para>
		<para>Example: <command moreinfo="none">name resolve order = lmhosts bcast host
		</command></para>

		<para>This will cause the local lmhosts file to be examined 
		first, followed by a broadcast attempt, followed by a normal 
		system hostname lookup.</para>
