		<term><anchor id="ALLOWTRUSTEDDOMAINS"/>allow trusted domains (G)</term>
		<listitem><para>This option only takes effect when the <link linkend="SECURITY"><parameter moreinfo="none">security</parameter></link> option is set to 
		<constant>server</constant> or <constant>domain</constant>.  
		If it is set to no, then attempts to connect to a resource from 
		a domain or workgroup other than the one which <ulink url="smbd.8.html">smbd</ulink> is running 
		in will fail, even if that domain is trusted by the remote server 
		doing the authentication.</para>
		
		<para>This is useful if you only want your Samba server to 
		serve resources to users in the domain it is a member of. As 
		an example, suppose that there are two domains DOMA and DOMB.  DOMB 
		is trusted by DOMA, which contains the Samba server.  Under normal 
		circumstances, a user with an account in DOMB can then access the 
		resources of a UNIX account with the same account name on the 
		Samba server even if they do not have an account in DOMA.  This 
		can make implementing a security boundary difficult.</para>

		<para>Default: <command moreinfo="none">allow trusted domains = yes</command></para>
