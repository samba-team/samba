<a class="indexterm" name="id2911255"></a>
Advanced MS Windows users are frequently perplexed when file, directory and share manipulation of
resources shared via Samba do not behave in the manner they might expect. MS Windows network
administrators are often confused regarding network access controls and how to
provide users with the access they need while protecting resources from unauthorized access.
</p><p>
Many UNIX administrators are unfamiliar with the MS Windows environment and in particular
have difficulty in visualizing what the MS Windows user wishes to achieve in attempts to set file
and directory access permissions. 
</p><p>
The problem lies in the differences in how file and directory permissions and controls work
between the two environments. This difference is one that Samba cannot completely hide, even
though it does try to bridge the chasm to a degree.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2911291"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2911300"></a>

POSIX Access Control List technology has been available (along with Extended Attributes)
for UNIX for many years, yet there is little evidence today of any significant use. This
explains to some extent the slow adoption of ACLs into commercial Linux products. MS Windows
administrators are astounded at this, given that ACLs were a foundational capability of the now
decade-old MS Windows NT operating system.
</p><p>
The purpose of this chapter is to present each of the points of control that are possible with
Samba-3 in the hope that this will help the network administrator to find the optimum method
for delivering the best environment for MS Windows desktop users.
</p><p>
This is an opportune point to mention that Samba was created to provide a means of interoperability
and interchange of data between differing operating environments. Samba has no intent to change
UNIX/Linux into a platform like MS Windows. Instead the purpose was and is to provide a sufficient
level of exchange of data between the two environments. What is available today extends well
beyond early plans and expectations, yet the gap continues to shrink.

	Samba offers a lot of flexibility in file system access management. These are the key access control
	facilities present in Samba today:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Samba Access Control Facilities</b></p><ul type="disc"><li><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id2911368"></a>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>UNIX File and Directory Permissions</em></span>
		</p><p>
			Samba honors and implements UNIX file system access controls. Users
			who access a Samba server will do so as a particular MS Windows user.
			This information is passed to the Samba server as part of the logon or
			connection setup process. Samba uses this user identity to validate
			whether or not the user should be given access to file system resources
			(files and directories). This chapter provides an overview for those
			to whom the UNIX permissions and controls are a little strange or unknown.
			</p></li><li><p>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>Samba Share Definitions</em></span>
		</p><p>
			In configuring share settings and controls in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file,
			the network administrator can exercise overrides to native file
			system permissions and behaviors. This can be handy and convenient
			to effect behavior that is more like what MS Windows NT users expect
			but it is seldom the <span class="emphasis"><em>best</em></span> way to achieve this.
			The basic options and techniques are described herein.
			</p></li><li><p>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>Samba Share ACLs</em></span>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2911453"></a>
		</p><p>
			Just like it is possible in MS Windows NT to set ACLs on shares
			themselves, so it is possible to do this in Samba.
			Few people make use of this facility, yet it remains on of the
			easiest ways to affect access controls (restrictions) and can often
			do so with minimum invasiveness compared with other methods.
			</p></li><li><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id2911481"></a>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id2911492"></a>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>MS Windows ACLs through UNIX POSIX ACLs</em></span>
		</p><p>
			The use of POSIX ACLs on UNIX/Linux is possible only if the underlying
			operating system supports them. If not, then this option will not be
			available to you. Current UNIX technology platforms have native support
			for POSIX ACLs. There are patches for the Linux kernel that also provide
			this. Sadly, few Linux platforms ship today with native ACLs and
			Extended Attributes enabled. This chapter has pertinent information
			for users of platforms that support them.

Perhaps the most important recognition to be made is the simple fact that MS Windows NT4/200x/XP
implement a totally divergent file system technology from what is provided in the UNIX operating system
environment. First we consider what the most significant differences are, then we look
at how Samba helps to bridge the differences.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2911543"></a>MS Windows NTFS Comparison with UNIX File Systems</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

	Samba operates on top of the UNIX file system. This means it is subject to UNIX file system conventions
	and permissions. It also means that if the MS Windows networking environment requires file system
	behavior that differs from UNIX file system behavior then somehow Samba is responsible for emulating
	that in a transparent and consistent manner.
	</p><p>
	It is good news that Samba does this to a large extent and on top of that provides a high degree
	of optional configuration to override the default behavior. We look at some of these over-rides,
	but for the greater part we will stay within the bounds of default behavior. Those wishing to explore
	the depths of control ability should review the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> man page.
	</p><p>The following compares file system features for UNIX with those of Microsoft Windows NT/200x:
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2911624"></a>
	
	</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Name Space</span></dt><dd><p>
		MS Windows NT4/200x/XP files names may be up to 254 characters long, and UNIX file names
		may be 1023 characters long. In MS Windows, file extensions indicate particular file types,
		in UNIX this is not so rigorously observed as all names are considered arbitrary. 
		</p><p>
		What MS Windows calls a folder, UNIX calls a directory.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Case Sensitivity</span></dt><dd><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2911680"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2911689"></a>
		MS Windows file names are generally upper case if made up of 8.3 (8 character file name
		and 3 character extension. File names that are longer than 8.3 are case preserving and case
		insensitive.
		</p><p>
		UNIX file and directory names are case sensitive and case preserving. Samba implements the
		MS Windows file name behavior, but it does so as a user application. The UNIX file system
		provides no mechanism to perform case insensitive file name lookups. MS Windows does this
		by default. This means that Samba has to carry the processing overhead to provide features
		that are not native to the UNIX operating system environment.
		</p><p>
		Consider the following. All are unique UNIX names but one single MS Windows file name:
		</p><pre class="screen">
				MYFILE.TXT
				MyFile.txt
				myfile.txt
		</pre><p>
		So clearly, in an MS Windows file name space these three files cannot co-exist, but in UNIX
		they can.
		</p><p>
		So what should Samba do if all three are present? That which is lexically first will be
		accessible to MS Windows users, the others are invisible and unaccessible  any
		other solution would be suicidal.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Directory Separators</span></dt><dd><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id2911762"></a>
		MS Windows and DOS uses the backslash <tt class="constant">\</tt> as a directory delimiter, and UNIX uses
		the forward-slash <tt class="constant">/</tt> as its directory delimiter. This is handled transparently by Samba.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Drive Identification</span></dt><dd><p>
			<a class="indexterm" name="id2911799"></a>
		MS Windows products support a notion of drive letters, like <b class="command">C:</b> to represent
		disk partitions. UNIX has no concept of separate identifiers for file partitions, each
		such file system is mounted to become part of the overall directory tree.
		The UNIX directory tree begins at <tt class="constant">/</tt> just like the root of a DOS drive is specified as
		<tt class="constant">C:\</tt>.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">File Naming Conventions</span></dt><dd><p>
			<a class="indexterm" name="id2911846"></a>
		MS Windows generally never experiences file names that begin with a dot (<tt class="constant">.</tt>) while in UNIX these
		are commonly found in a user's home directory. Files that begin with a dot (<tt class="constant">.</tt>) are typically
		either start-up files for various UNIX applications, or they may be files that contain
		start-up configuration data.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Links and Short-Cuts</span></dt><dd><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2911886"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2911897"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2911908"></a>
		MS Windows make use of &#8220;<span class="quote">links and short-cuts</span>&#8221; that are actually special types of files that will
		redirect an attempt to execute the file to the real location of the file. UNIX knows of file and directory
		links, but they are entirely different from what MS Windows users are used to.
		</p><p>
		Symbolic links are files in UNIX that contain the actual location of the data (file or directory). An
		operation (like read or write) will operate directly on the file referenced. Symbolic links are also
		referred to as &#8220;<span class="quote">soft links.</span>&#8221; A hard link is something that MS Windows is not familiar with. It allows
		one physical file to be known simultaneously by more than one file name.
		</p></dd></dl></div><p>
	There are many other subtle differences that may cause the MS Windows administrator some temporary discomfort
	in the process of becoming familiar with UNIX/Linux. These are best left for a text that is dedicated to the
	purpose of UNIX/Linux training and education.

	<a class="indexterm" name="id2912062"></a>
	The network administrator is strongly advised to read foundational training manuals and reference materials
	regarding file and directory permissions maintenance. Much can be achieved with the basic UNIX permissions
	without having to resort to more complex facilities like POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Extended
	Attributes (EAs).

	UNIX/Linux file and directory access permissions involves setting three primary sets of data and one control set.

	</p><p>
	Additional possibilities in the [type] field are: c = character device, b = block device, p = pipe device, s = UNIX Domain Socket.
	</p><p>
	The letters <tt class="constant">rwxXst</tt> set permissions for the user, group and others as: read (r), write (w), execute (or access for directories) (x),
	execute  only  if  the  file  is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s),
	sticky (t).
	</p><p>
	When the sticky bit is set on a directory, files in that directory may be unlinked (deleted) or renamed only by root or their owner. 
	Without the sticky  bit, anyone able to write to the directory can delete or rename files. The sticky bit is commonly found on
	directories, such as <tt class="filename">/tmp</tt>, that are world-writable.
	</p><p>
	When the set user or group ID bit (s) is set on a directory, then all files created within it will be owned by the user and/or
	group whose `set user or group' bit is set. This can be helpful in setting up directories for which it is desired that
	all users who are in a group should be able to write to and read from a file, particularly when it is undesirable for that file
	to be exclusively owned by a user whose primary group is not the group that all such users belong to.
	</p><p>
	When a directory is set <tt class="constant">drw-r-----</tt> this means that the owner can read and create (write) files in it, but because
	the (x) execute flags are not set, files cannot be listed (seen) in the directory by anyone. The group can read files in the
	directory but cannot create new files. If files in the directory are set to be readable and writable for the group, then
	group members will be able to write to (or delete) them.

The following parameters in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file sections define a share control or effect access controls.

</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2912329"></a>User and Group-Based Controls</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	User and group-based controls can prove quite useful. In some situations it is distinctly desirable to affect all
	file system operations as if a single user were doing so. The use of the <a class="indexterm" name="id2912343"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>force user</tt></i> and 
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2912356"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>force group</tt></i> behavior will achieve this. In other situations it may be necessary to effect a
	paranoia level of control to ensure that only particular authorized persons will be able to access a share or
	its contents. Here the use of the <a class="indexterm" name="id2912374"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>valid users</tt></i> or the
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2912388"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>invalid users</tt></i> may be most useful.
	</p><p>
	As always, it is highly advisable to use the least difficult to maintain and the least ambiguous method for
	controlling access. Remember, when you leave the scene someone else will need to provide assistance and
	if he finds too great a mess or does not understand what you have done, there is risk of
	Samba being removed and an alternative solution being adopted.

<a class="indexterm" name="id2913597"></a>
	This section deals with how to configure Samba per share access control restrictions.
	By default, Samba sets no restrictions on the share itself. Restrictions on the share itself
	can be set on MS Windows NT4/200x/XP shares. This can be an effective way to limit who can
	connect to a share. In the absence of specific restrictions the default setting is to allow
	the global user <tt class="constant">Everyone - Full Control</tt> (full control, change and read).
	</p><p>
	At this time Samba does not provide a tool for configuring access control setting on the share
	itself. Samba does have the capacity to store and act on access control settings, but  the only
	way to create those settings is to use either the NT4 Server Manager or the Windows 200x MMC for
	Computer Management.
	</p><p>
	Samba stores the per share access control settings in a file called <tt class="filename">share_info.tdb</tt>.
	The location of this file on your system will depend on how Samba was compiled. The default location
	for Samba's tdb files is under <tt class="filename">/usr/local/samba/var</tt>. If the <tt class="filename">tdbdump</tt>
	utility has been compiled and installed on your system, then you can examine the contents of this file
	by executing: <b class="command">tdbdump share_info.tdb</b> in the directory containing the tdb files.

			The tool you need to use to manage share permissions on a Samba server is the NT Server Manager.
			Server Manager is shipped with Windows NT4 Server products but not with Windows NT4 Workstation.
			You can obtain the NT Server Manager for MS Windows NT4 Workstation from Microsoft  see details below.

			On <span class="application">MS Windows NT4/200x/XP</span> system access control lists on the share itself are set using native
			tools, usually from File Manager. For example, in Windows 200x, right click on the shared folder,
			then select <span class="guimenuitem">Sharing</span>, then click on <span class="guilabel">Permissions</span>. The default 
			Windows NT4/200x permission allows &#8220;<span class="quote">Everyone</span>&#8221; full control on the share.
			</p><p>
			MS Windows 200x and later versions come with a tool called the <span class="application">Computer Management</span> snap-in for the
			Microsoft Management Console (MMC). This tool is located by clicking on <span class="guimenu">Control Panel -&gt;

		All access to UNIX/Linux system files via Samba is controlled by the operating system file access controls.

		From an NT4/2000/XP client, right click on any file or directory in a Samba-mounted drive letter
		or UNC path. When the menu pops up, click on the <span class="guilabel">Properties</span> entry at the bottom
		of the menu. This brings up the file <tt class="constant">Properties</tt> dialog box. Click on the

		<span class="guibutton">Auditing</span>, and <span class="guibutton">Ownership</span>. The <span class="guibutton">Auditing</span>
		button will cause either an error message <span class="errorname">`A requested privilege is not held by the client'</span>
		to appear if the user is not the NT Administrator, or a dialog which is intended to allow an Administrator
		to add auditing requirements to a file if the user is logged on as the NT Administrator. This dialog is
		non-functional with a Samba share at this time, as the only useful button, the <span class="guibutton">Add</span>

		Clicking on the <span class="guibutton">Ownership</span> button brings up a dialog box telling you who owns
		the given file. The owner name will be displayed like this:
		</p><p>
		<b class="command">&#8220;<span class="quote">SERVER\user (Long name)</span>&#8221;</b>
		</p><p>
		<i class="replaceable"><tt>SERVER</tt></i> is the NetBIOS name of the Samba server, <i class="replaceable"><tt>user</tt></i>
		is the user name of the UNIX user who owns the file, and <i class="replaceable"><tt>(Long name)</tt></i> is the
		descriptive string identifying the user (normally found in the GECOS field of the UNIX password database).
		Click on the <span class="guibutton">Close </span> button to remove this dialog.
		</p><p>
		If the parameter <a class="indexterm" name="id2914189"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>nt acl support</tt></i> is set to <tt class="constant">false</tt>,
		the file owner will be shown as the NT user <span class="emphasis"><em>Everyone</em></span>.
		</p><p>
		The <span class="guibutton">Take Ownership</span> button will not allow you to change the ownership of this file to
		yourself (clicking it will display a dialog box complaining that the user you are currently logged onto
		the NT client cannot be found). The reason for this is that changing the ownership of a file is a privileged
		operation in UNIX, available only to the <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span> user. As clicking on this button causes
		NT to attempt to change the ownership of a file to the current user logged into the NT clienti, this will
		not work with Samba at this time.</p><p>
		There is an NT <b class="command">chown</b> command that will work with Samba and allow a user with Administrator privilege connected 
		to a Samba server as root to change the ownership of files on both a local NTFS filesystem or remote mounted NTFS 
		or Samba drive. This is available as part of the <span class="application">Seclib</span> NT security library written

		The third button is the <span class="guibutton">Permissions</span> button. Clicking on this brings up a dialog box

			of permissions allowed for the UNIX user and group.</p><p>Because many UNIX permission sets do not map into common NT names such as <tt class="constant">read</tt>,
			<tt class="constant">change</tt> or <tt class="constant">full control</tt>, usually the permissions will be prefixed
			by the words <tt class="constant">Special Access</tt> in the NT display list.</p><p>But what happens if the file has no permissions allowed for a particular UNIX user group or world component? In order 
			to  allow &#8220;<span class="quote">no permissions</span>&#8221; to be seen and modified Samba then overloads the NT <tt class="constant">Take Ownership</tt> ACL attribute

		button will not return a list of users in Samba (it will give 
		an error message saying <span class="errorname">`The remote procedure call failed 
		and did not execute'</span>). This means that you can only 
		manipulate the current user/group/world permissions listed in 
		the dialog box. This actually works quite well as these are the

		as the NT <b class="command">O</b> flag, as described above. This 
		allows you to add permissions back to a file or directory once

		are forced to be set.</p><p>Essentially, bits set in the <i class="parameter"><tt>force security mode</tt></i> parameter
		may be treated as a set of bits that, when modifying security on a file, the user has always set to be &#8220;<span class="quote">on</span>&#8221;.</p><p>If not explicitly set, this parameter defaults to the same value 
		as the <a class="indexterm" name="id2914918"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>force create mode</tt></i> parameter.
		To allow a user to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a file
		with no restrictions set this parameter to 000. The
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2914935"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>security mask</tt></i> and <i class="parameter"><tt>force 
		security mode</tt></i> parameters are applied to the change

		described above for a file except it uses the parameter <i class="parameter"><tt>
		directory security mask</tt></i> instead of <i class="parameter"><tt>security 
		mask</tt></i>, and <i class="parameter"><tt>force directory security mode
		</tt></i> parameter instead of <i class="parameter"><tt>force security mode
		</tt></i>.</p><p>The <a class="indexterm" name="id2914996"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>directory security mask</tt></i> parameter 
		by default is set to the same value as the <i class="parameter"><tt>directory mask

		mode</tt></i> parameter by default is set to the same value as 
		the <a class="indexterm" name="id2915027"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>force directory mode</tt></i> parameter.
		In this way Samba enforces the permission restrictions that 
		an administrator can set on a Samba share, while still allowing users 
		to modify the permission bits within that restriction.</p><p>If you want to set up a share that allows users full control
		in modifying the permission bits on their files and directories and

File, directory and share access problems are common on the mailing list. The following
are examples taken from the mailing list in recent times.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2915209"></a>Users Cannot Write to a Public Share</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

	We are facing some troubles with file/directory permissions. I can log on the domain as admin user(root),
	and there's a public share on which everyone needs to have permission to create/modify files, but only
	root can change the file, no one else can. We need to constantly go to the server to
	<b class="userinput"><tt>chgrp -R users *</tt></b> and <b class="userinput"><tt>chown -R nobody *</tt></b> to allow others users to change the file.
	</span>&#8221;
	</p><p>
	There are many ways to solve this problem and here are a few hints:
	</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
			Go to the top of the directory that is shared.
			</p></li><li><p>
			Set the ownership to what ever public owner and group you want
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt>find 'directory_name' -type d -exec chown user.group {}\;
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt>find 'directory_name' -type d -exec chmod 6775 'directory_name'
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt>find 'directory_name' -type f -exec chmod 0775 {} \;
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt>find 'directory_name' -type f -exec chown user.group {}\;
</pre><p>
			</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
			The above will set the <tt class="constant">sticky bit</tt> on all directories. Read your
			UNIX/Linux man page on what that does. It causes the OS to assign 
			to all files created in the directories the ownership of the 
			directory.
			</p></div></li><li><p>

			Directory is: <i class="replaceable"><tt>/foodbar</tt></i>
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>chown jack.engr /foodbar</tt></b>
</pre><p>
			</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
				</p><p>This is the same as doing:</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>chown jack /foodbar</tt></b>
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>chgrp engr /foodbar</tt></b>
</pre><p>
			</p></div></li><li><p>Now type: 

</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>chmod 6775 /foodbar</tt></b>
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>ls -al /foodbar/..</tt></b>
</pre><p>

			</p><p>You should see:
</p><pre class="screen">
drwsrwsr-x  2 jack  engr    48 2003-02-04 09:55 foodbar
</pre><p>
			</p></li><li><p>Now type:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>su - jill</tt></b>
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>cd /foodbar</tt></b>
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>touch Afile</tt></b>
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>ls -al</tt></b>
</pre><p>
		</p><p>
		You should see that the file <tt class="filename">Afile</tt> created by Jill will have ownership
		and permissions of Jack, as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
-rw-r--r--  1 jack  engr     0 2003-02-04 09:57 Afile
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p>
		Now in your <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> for the share add:
		</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>force create mode = 0775</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>force direcrtory mode = 6775</tt></i></td></tr></table><p>
		</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
		These procedures are needed only if your users are not members of the group
		you have used. That is if within the OS do not have write permission on the directory.
		</p></div><p>
		An alternative is to set in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> entry for the share:
		</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>force user = jack</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>force group = engr</tt></i></td></tr></table><p>
		</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2915635"></a>File Operations Done as <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span> with <span class="emphasis"><em>force user</em></span> Set</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
		When you have a user in <a class="indexterm" name="id2915654"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>admin users</tt></i>, Samba will always do file operations for
		this user as <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span>, even if <a class="indexterm" name="id2915674"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>force user</tt></i> has been set.
		</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2915690"></a>MS Word with Samba Changes Owner of File</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>Question:</em></span> &#8220;<span class="quote">When user B saves a word document that is owned by user A the updated file is now owned by user B.
		Why is Samba doing this? How do I fix this?</span>&#8221;
		</p><p>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>Answer:</em></span> Word does the following when you modify/change a Word document: MS Word creates a NEW document with
		a temporary name, Word then closes the old document and deletes it, Word then renames the new document to the original document name.
		There is no mechanism by which Samba can in any way know that the new document really should be owned by the owners
		of the original file. Samba has no way of knowing that the file will be renamed by MS Word. As far as Samba is able
		to tell, the file that gets created is a NEW file, not one that the application (Word) is updating.
		</p><p>
		There is a work-around to solve the permissions problem. That work-around involves understanding how you can manage file
		system behavior from within the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file, as well as understanding how UNIX file systems work. Set on the directory
		in which you are changing Word documents: <b class="command">chmod g+s `directory_name'</b> This ensures that all files will
		be created with the group that owns the directory. In <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> share declaration section set:
		</p><p>
		</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>force create mode = 0660</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>force directory mode = 0770</tt></i></td></tr></table><p>
		</p><p>
		These two settings will ensure that all directories and files that get created in the share will be read/writable by the
		owner and group set on the directory itself.
