There are many and varied opinions regarding the usefulness of SWAT.
No matter how hard one tries to produce the perfect configuration tool, it remains
an object of personal taste. SWAT is a tool that will allow Web-based configuration
of Samba. It has a wizard that may help to get Samba configured
quickly, it has context-sensitive help on each <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> parameter, it provides for monitoring of current state
of connection information, and it allows network-wide MS Windows network password
management.
</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2967624"></a>Features and Benefits</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
SWAT is a facility that is part of the Samba suite. The main executable is called
<b class="command">swat</b> and is invoked by the inter-networking super daemon.
See <link linkend="xinetd"> for details.
</p><p>
SWAT uses integral samba components to locate parameters supported by the particular
version of Samba. Unlike tools and utilities that are external to Samba, SWAT is always
up to date as known Samba parameters change. SWAT provides context-sensitive help for each
configuration parameter, directly from <b class="command">man</b> page entries.
</p><p>
There are network administrators who believe that it is a good idea to write systems
documentation inside configuration files, and for them SWAT will aways be a nasty tool. SWAT
does not store the configuration file in any intermediate form, rather, it stores only the
parameter settings, so when SWAT writes the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file to disk, it will write only
those parameters that are at other than the default settings. The result is that all comments,
as well as parameters that are no longer supported, will be lost from the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file.
Additionally, the parameters will be written back in internal ordering.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
Before using SWAT, please be warned  SWAT will completely replace your <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> with
a fully-optimized file that has been stripped of all comments you might have placed there
and only non-default settings will be written to the file.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2967718"></a>Guidelines and Technical Tips</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
This section aims to unlock the dark secrets behind how SWAT may be made to work,
may be made more secure, and how to solve Internationalization support problems.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2967733"></a>Validate SWAT Installation</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The very first step that should be taken before attempting to configure a host
system for SWAT operation is to check that it is installed. This may seem a trivial
point to some, however several Linux distributions do not install SWAT by default,
even though they do ship an installable binary support package containing SWAT
on the distribution media.
</p><p>
When you have configrmed that SWAT is installed it is necessary to validate
that the installation includes the binary <b class="command">swat</b> file as well
as all the supporting text and Web files. A number of operating system distributions
in the past have failed to include the necessary support files, evne though the
<b class="command">swat</b> binary executable file was installed. 
</p><p>
Finally, when you are sure that SWAT has been fully installed, please check the SWAT
has been enebled in the control file for the internetworking super-daemon (inetd or xinetd)
that is used on your operating system platform. 
</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2967782"></a>Locating the <b class="command">swat</b> File</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
To validate that SWAT is installed, first locate the <b class="command">swat</b> binary
file on the system. It may be found under the following directories:
</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><tt class="filename">/usr/local/samba/bin</tt>  the default Samba location.</td></tr><tr><td><tt class="filename">/usr/sbin</tt>  the default location on most Linux systems.</td></tr><tr><td><tt class="filename">/opt/samba/bin</tt></td></tr></table><p>
</p><p>
The actual location is much dependant on the choice of the operating system vendor, or as determined
by the administrator who compiled and installed Samba.
</p><p>
There are a number methods that may be used to locate the <b class="command">swat</b> binary file.
The following methods may be helpful:
</p><p>
If <b class="command">swat</b> is in your current operating system search path it will be easy to 
find it. You can ask what are the command-line options for <b class="command">swat</b> as shown here:
</p><pre class="screen">
frodo:~ # swat -?
Usage: swat [OPTION...]
  -a, --disable-authentication         Disable authentication (demo mode)

Help options:
  -?, --help                           Show this help message
  --usage                              Display brief usage message

Common samba options:
  -d, --debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL          Set debug level
  -s, --configfile=CONFIGFILE          Use alternative configuration file
  -l, --log-basename=LOGFILEBASE       Basename for log/debug files
  -V, --version                        Print version
</pre><p>
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2967911"></a>Locating the SWAT Support Files</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Now that you have found that <b class="command">swat</b> is in the search path, it is easy
to identify where the file is located. Here is another simple way this may be done:
</p><pre class="screen">
frodo:~ # whereis swat
swat: /usr/sbin/swat /usr/share/man/man8/swat.8.gz
</pre><p>
</p><p>
If the above measures fail to locate the <b class="command">swat</b> binary, another approach
is needed. The following may be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
frodo:/ # find / -name swat -print
/etc/xinetd.d/swat
/usr/sbin/swat
/usr/share/samba/swat
frodo:/ #
</pre><p>
</p><p>
This list shows that there is a control file for <b class="command">xinetd</b>, the internetwork
super-daemon that is installed on this server. The location of the SWAT binary file is
<tt class="filename">/usr/sbin/swat</tt>, and the support files for it are located under the
directory <tt class="filename">/usr/share/samba/swat</tt>.
</p><p>
We must now check where <b class="command">swat</b> expects to find its support files. This can
be done as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
frodo:/ # strings /usr/sbin/swat | grep "/swat"
/swat/
...
/usr/share/samba/swat
frodo:/ #
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The <tt class="filename">/usr/share/samba/swat/</tt> entry shown in this listing is the location of the
support files. You should verify that the support files exist under this directory. A sample
list is as shown:
</p><pre class="screen">

If the files needed are not available it will be necessary to obtain and install them
before SWAT can be used.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="xinetd"></a>Enabling SWAT for Use</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
SWAT should be installed to run via the network super-daemon. Depending on which system
your UNIX/Linux system has, you will have either an <b class="command">inetd</b>- or
<b class="command">xinetd</b>-based system.
</p><p>
The nature and location of the network super-daemon varies with the operating system
implementation. The control file (or files) can be located in the file 
<tt class="filename">/etc/inetd.conf</tt> or in the directory <tt class="filename">/etc/[x]inet[d].d</tt>
or similar.
</p><p>
The control entry for the older style file might be:
<a class="indexterm" name="id2968135"></a>
</p><pre class="programlisting">
	# swat is the Samba Web Administration Tool
	swat stream tcp nowait.400 root /usr/sbin/swat swat
</pre><p>
A control file for the newer style xinetd could be:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="programlisting">
# default: off
# description: SWAT is the Samba Web Admin Tool. Use swat \
#              to configure your Samba server. To use SWAT, \
#              connect to port 901 with your favorite web browser.
service swat
{
	port    = 901
	socket_type     = stream
	wait    = no
	only_from = localhost
	user    = root
	server  = /usr/sbin/swat
	log_on_failure  += USERID
	disable = yes
}
</pre><p>

</p><p>
Both of the above examples assume that the <b class="command">swat</b> binary has been
located in the <tt class="filename">/usr/sbin</tt> directory. In addition to the above,
SWAT will use a directory access point from which it will load its Help files
as well as other control information. The default location for this on most Linux
systems is in the directory <tt class="filename">/usr/share/samba/swat</tt>. The default
location using Samba defaults will be <tt class="filename">/usr/local/samba/swat</tt>.
</p><p>
Access to SWAT will prompt for a logon. If you log onto SWAT as any non-root user,
the only permission allowed is to view certain aspects of configuration as well as
access to the password change facility. The buttons that will be exposed to the non-root
user are: <span class="guibutton">HOME</span>, <span class="guibutton">STATUS</span>, <span class="guibutton">VIEW</span>, 
<span class="guibutton">PASSWORD</span>. The only page that allows
change capability in this case is <span class="guibutton">PASSWORD</span>.
</p><p>
As long as you log onto SWAT as the user <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span>, you should obtain
full change and commit ability. The buttons that will be exposed include:
<span class="guibutton">HOME</span>, <span class="guibutton">GLOBALS</span>, <span class="guibutton">SHARES</span>, <span class="guibutton">PRINTERS</span>, 
<span class="guibutton">WIZARD</span>, <span class="guibutton">STATUS</span>, <span class="guibutton">VIEW</span>, <span class="guibutton">PASSWORD</span>.

<a class="indexterm" name="id2968341"></a>
Many people have asked about how to setup SWAT with SSL to allow for secure remote
administration of Samba. Here is a method that works, courtesy of Markus Krieger.
</p><p>
Modifications to the SWAT setup are as follows: 
</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	Install OpenSSL.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Generate certificate and private key.

</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>/usr/bin/openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -config \
	/usr/share/doc/packages/stunnel/stunnel.cnf \
	-out /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem -keyout /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem</tt></b>
</pre></li><li><p>
	Remove swat-entry from [x]inetd.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Start <b class="command">stunnel</b>.

</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>stunnel -p /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem -d 901 \
	 -l /usr/local/samba/bin/swat swat </tt></b>
</pre></li></ol></div><p>
Afterward, simply connect to swat by using the URL <ulink url="https://myhost:901">https://myhost:901</ulink>, accept the certificate
and the SSL connection is up.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2968458"></a>Enabling SWAT Internationalization Support</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
SWAT can be configured to display its messages to match the settings of
the language configurations of your Web browser. It will be passed to SWAT 
in the Accept-Language header of the HTTP request.
</p><p>

</p><p>
To enable this feature:
</p><p>

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Install  the proper <b class="command">msg</b> files from the Samba
	<tt class="filename">source/po</tt> directory into $LIBDIR.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Set the correct locale value for <a class="indexterm" name="id2968509"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>display charset</tt></i>.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Set your browser's language setting.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>
The name of msg file is same as the language ID sent by the browser. For
example en means "English", ja means "Japanese", fr means "French.
</p><p>

</p><p>
If you do not like some of messages, or there are no <b class="command">msg</b> files for
your locale, you can create them simply by copying the <b class="command">en.msg</b> files
to the dirertory for &#8220;<span class="quote">your language ID.msg</span>&#8221; and filling in proper strings
to each &#8220;<span class="quote">msgstr</span>&#8221;. For example, in <tt class="filename">it.msg</tt>, the
<b class="command">msg</b> file for the Italian locale, just set:
</p><pre class="screen">
msgid "Set Default"
msgstr "Imposta Default"
</pre><p>
and so on. If you find a mistake or create a new <b class="command">msg</b> file, please email it
to us so we will include this in the next release of Samba.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Note that if you enable this feature and the <a class="indexterm" name="id2968601"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>display charset</tt></i> is not
matched to your browser's setting, the SWAT display may be corrupted.  In a future version of
Samba, SWAT will always display messages with UTF-8 encoding. You will then not need to set
this <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file parameter.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2968628"></a>Overview and Quick Tour</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
SWAT is a tools that many be used to configure Samba, or just to obtain useful links
to important reference materials such as the contents of this book, as well as other
documents that have been found useful for solving Windows networking problems.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2968644"></a>The SWAT Home Page</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The SWAT title page provides access to the latest Samba documentation. The manual page for
each Samba component is accessible from this page, as are the Samba HOWTO-Collection (this 
document) as well as the O'Reilly book &#8220;<span class="quote">Using Samba.</span>&#8221;
</p><p>
Administrators who wish to validate their Samba configuration may obtain useful information
from the man pages for the diagnostic utilities. These are available from the SWAT home page
also. One diagnostic tool that is not mentioned on this page, but that is particularly
useful is <ulink url="http://www.ethereal.com/">ethereal.</ulink>
</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
SWAT can be configured to run in <span class="emphasis"><em>demo</em></span> mode. This is not recommended
as it runs SWAT without authentication and with full administrative ability. Allows
changes to <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> as well as general operation with root privileges. The option that
creates this ability is the <tt class="option">-a</tt> flag to swat. <span class="emphasis"><em>Do not use this in a

The <span class="guibutton">GLOBALS</span> button will expose a page that allows configuration of the global parameters
in <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>. There are two levels of exposure of the parameters:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	<span class="guibutton">Basic</span>  exposes common configuration options.

To switch to other than <span class="guibutton">Basic</span> editing ability, click on <span class="guibutton">Advanced</span>.
You may also do this by clicking on the radio button, then click on the <span class="guibutton">Commit Changes</span> button.
</p><p>
After making any changes to configuration parameters, make sure that
you click on the 
<span class="guibutton">Commit Changes</span> button before moving to another area, otherwise
your changes will be lost.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
SWAT has context-sensitive help. To find out what each parameter is
for, simply click on the

The purpose if the SWAT Wizard is to help the Microsoft-knowledgeable network administrator
to configure Samba with a minimum of effort.
</p><p>
The Wizard page provides a tool for rewriting the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file in fully optimized format.
This will also happen if you press the <span class="guibutton">Commit</span> button. The two differ
since the <span class="guibutton">Rewrite</span> button ignores any changes that may have been made,
while the <span class="guibutton">Commit</span> button causes all changes to be affected.
</p><p>
The <span class="guibutton">Edit</span> button permits the editing (setting) of the minimal set of
options that may be necessary to create a working Samba server.
</p><p>
Finally, there are a limited set of options that will determine what type of server Samba
will be configured for, whether it will be a WINS server, participate as a WINS client, or
operate with no WINS support. By clicking one button, you can elect to expose (or not) user
home directories.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2969040"></a>The Status Page</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The status page serves a limited purpose. First, it allows control of the Samba daemons.
The key daemons that create the Samba server environment are: <span class="application">smbd</span>, <span class="application">nmbd</span>, <span class="application">winbindd</span>.
</p><p>
The daemons may be controlled individually or as a total group. Additionally, you may set
an automatic screen refresh timing. As MS Windows clients interact with Samba, new smbd processes
will be continually spawned. The auto-refresh facility will allow you to track the changing
conditions with minimal effort.
</p><p>
Lastly, the Status page may be used to terminate specific smbd client connections in order to
free files that may be locked.

This page allows the administrator to view the optimized <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file and, if you are
particularly masochistic, will permit you also to see all possible global configuration
parameters and their settings.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2969115"></a>The Password Change Page</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The Password Change page is a popular tool that allows the creation, deletion, deactivation,
and reactivation of MS Windows networking users on the local machine. Alternately, you can use
this tool to change a local password for a user account.
</p><p>
When logged in as a non-root account, the user will have to provide the old password as well as
the new password (twice). When logged in as <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span>, only the new password is
required.
</p><p>
