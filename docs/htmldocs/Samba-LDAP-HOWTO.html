account information traditionally stored in the smbpasswd(5) file.  It is
assumed that the reader already has a basic understanding of LDAP concepts
and has a working directory server already installed.  For more information

> file, user account
information such as username, LM/NT password hashes, password change times, and account
flags have been stored in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smbpasswd(5)</TT
> file.  There are several
disadvantages to this approach for sites with very large numbers of users (counted
in the thousands).</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The first is that all lookups must be performed sequentially.  Given that
there are approximately two lookups per domain logon (one for a normal
session connection such as when mapping a network drive or printer), this
is a performance bottleneck for lareg sites.  What is needed is an indexed approach
such as is used in databases.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The second problem is that administrators who desired to replicate a
smbpasswd file to more than one Samba server were left to use external
tools such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rsync(1)</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh(1)</B
>
and wrote custom, in-house scripts.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>And finally, the amount of information which is stored in an
smbpasswd entry leaves no room for additional attributes such as
a home directory, password expiration time, or even a Relative
Identified (RID).</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>As a result of these defeciencies, a more robust means of storing user attributes
used by smbd was developed.  The API which defines access to user accounts
is commonly referred to as the samdb interface (previously this was called the passdb
API, and is still so named in the CVS trees). In Samba 2.2.3, enabling support
for a samdb backend (e.g. <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-ldapsam</I
></TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-tdbsam</I
></TT
>) requires compile time support.</P
><P
>When compiling Samba to include the <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-ldapsam</I
></TT
> autoconf
option, smbd (and associated tools) will store and lookup user accounts in
an LDAP directory.  In reality, this is very easy to understand.  If you are
comfortable with using an smbpasswd file, simply replace "smbpasswd" with
"LDAP directory" in all the documentation.</P
><P
>There are a few points to stress about what the <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-ldapsam</I
></TT
>
does not provide.  The LDAP support referred to in the this documentation does not
include:</P

><P
>A means of retrieving user account information from
	an Windows 2000 Active Directory server.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A means of replacing /etc/passwd.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>The second item can be accomplished by using LDAP NSS and PAM modules.  LGPL
versions of these libraries can be obtained from PADL Software
(<A

Netscape's Directory Server and client SDK. However, due to lack of testing
so far, there are bound to be compile errors and bugs.  These should not be

HREF="jerry@samba.org"

></P
><P
>Just as the smbpasswd file is mean to store information which supplements a
user's <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> entry, so is the sambaAccount object
meant to supplement the UNIX user account information.  A sambaAccount is a
<TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>STRUCTURAL</TT
> objectclass so it can be stored individually
in the directory.  However, there are several fields (e.g. uid) which overlap
with the posixAccount objectclass outlined in RFC2307.  This is by design.</P
><P
>In order to store all user account information (UNIX and Samba) in the directory,
it is necessary to use the sambaAccount and posixAccount objectclasses in
combination.  However, smbd will still obtain the user's UNIX account
information via the standard C library calls (e.g. getpwnam(), et. al.).
This means that the Samba server must also have the LDAP NSS library installed
and functioning correctly.  This division of information makes it possible to
store all Samba account information in LDAP, but still maintain UNIX account
information in NIS while the network is transitioning to a full LDAP infrastructure.</P
