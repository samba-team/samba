><P
>By default Samba uses a blank scope ID. This means 
		all your windows boxes must also have a blank scope ID. 
		If you really want to use a non-blank scope ID then you will 
		need to use the 'netbios scope' smb.conf option.
        All your PCs will need to have the same setting for 
		this to work. I do not recommend scope IDs.</P

>1.6.2. Locking</A
></H2
><P
>One area which sometimes causes trouble is locking.</P
><P
>There are two types of locking which need to be 
		performed by a SMB server. The first is "record locking" 
		which allows a client to lock a range of bytes in a open file. 
		The second is the "deny modes" that are specified when a file 
		is open.</P
><P
>Record locking semantics under Unix is very
		different from record locking under Windows. Versions
		of Samba before 2.2 have tried to use the native
		fcntl() unix system call to implement proper record
		locking between different Samba clients. This can not
		be fully correct due to several reasons. The simplest
		is the fact that a Windows client is allowed to lock a
		byte range up to 2^32 or 2^64, depending on the client
		OS. The unix locking only supports byte ranges up to
		2^31. So it is not possible to correctly satisfy a
		lock request above 2^31. There are many more
		differences, too many to be listed here.</P
><P
>Samba 2.2 and above implements record locking
		completely independent of the underlying unix
		system. If a byte range lock that the client requests
		happens to fall into the range 0-2^31, Samba hands
		this request down to the Unix system. All other locks
		can not be seen by unix anyway.</P
><P
>Strictly a SMB server should check for locks before 
		every read and write call on a file. Unfortunately with the 
		way fcntl() works this can be slow and may overstress the 
		rpc.lockd. It is also almost always unnecessary as clients 
		are supposed to independently make locking calls before reads 
		and writes anyway if locking is important to them. By default 
		Samba only makes locking calls when explicitly asked
		to by a client, but if you set "strict locking = yes" then it will
		make lock checking calls on every read and write. </P
><P
>You can also disable by range locking completely 
		using "locking = no". This is useful for those shares that 
		don't support locking or don't need it (such as cdroms). In 
		this case Samba fakes the return codes of locking calls to 
		tell clients that everything is OK.</P
><P
>The second class of locking is the "deny modes". These 
		are set by an application when it opens a file to determine 
		what types of access should be allowed simultaneously with 
		its open. A client may ask for DENY_NONE, DENY_READ, DENY_WRITE 
		or DENY_ALL. There are also special compatibility modes called 
		DENY_FCB and  DENY_DOS.</P
