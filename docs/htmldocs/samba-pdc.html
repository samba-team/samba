There are many who approach MS Windows networking with incredible misconceptions.
That's okay, because it gives the rest of us plenty of opportunity to be of assistance.
Those who really want help would be well advised to become familiar with information
that is already available.
</p><p>
The reader is advised not to tackle this section without having first understood
and mastered some basics. MS Windows networking is not particularly forgiving of
misconfiguration. Users of MS Windows networking are likely to complain 
of persistent niggles that may be caused by a broken network configuration.
To a great many people, however, MS Windows networking starts with a Domain Controller
that in some magical way is expected to solve all network operational ills.
</p><p>
The diagram in <link linkend="domain-example"> shows a typical MS Windows Domain Security
network environment. Workstations A, B and C are representative of many physical MS Windows
network clients.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="domain-example"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 5.1. An Example Domain.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="projdoc/imagefiles/domain.png" width="270" alt="An Example Domain."></div></div><p>
From the Samba mailing list one can readily identify many common networking issues.
If you are not clear on the following subjects, then it will do much good to read the 
sections of this HOWTO that deal with it. These are the most common causes of MS Windows
networking problems:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Basic TCP/IP configuration.</p></li><li><p>NetBIOS name resolution.</p></li><li><p>Authentication configuration.</p></li><li><p>User and group configuration.</p></li><li><p>Basic file and directory permission control in UNIX/Linux.</p></li><li><p>Understanding how MS Windows clients interoperate in a network
		environment.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Do not be put off; on the surface of it MS Windows networking seems so simple that anyone 
can do it. In fact, it is not a good idea to set up an MS Windows network with
inadequate training and preparation. But let's get our first indelible principle out of the
way: <span class="emphasis"><em>It is perfectly okay to make mistakes!</em></span> In the right place and at
the right time, mistakes are the essence of learning. It is very much not okay to make
mistakes that cause loss of productivity and impose an avoidable financial burden on an
organization.
</p><p>
Where is the right place to make mistakes? Only out of harm's way. If you are going to
make mistakes, then please do it on a test network, away from users and in such a way as
to not inflict pain on others. Do your learning on a test network.
</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2870050"></a>Features and Benefits</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2870061"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What is the key benefit of Microsoft Domain Security?</em></span>
</p><p>
In a word, <span class="emphasis"><em>Single Sign On</em></span>, or SSO for short. To many, this is the Holy
Grail of MS Windows NT and beyond networking. SSO allows users in a well-designed network
to log onto any workstation that is a member of the domain that their user account is in
(or in a domain that has an appropriate trust relationship with the domain they are visiting)
and they will be able to log onto the network and access resources (shares, files and printers)
as if they are sitting at their home (personal) workstation. This is a feature of the Domain
Security protocols.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2870098"></a>
The benefits of Domain Security are available to those sites that deploy a Samba PDC.
A Domain provides a unique network security identifier (SID). Domain user and group security
identifiers are comprised of the network SID plus a relative identifier (RID) that is unique to
the account. User and Group SIDs (the network SID plus the RID) can be used to create Access Control
Lists (ACLs) attached to network resources to provide organizational access control. UNIX systems
recognize only local security identifiers.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
Network clients of an MS Windows Domain Security Environment must be Domain Members to be
able to gain access to the advanced features provided. Domain Membership involves more than just
setting the workgroup name to the Domain name. It requires the creation of a Domain trust account
for the workstation (called a machine account). Refer to <link linkend="domain-member">
for more information.

The following functionalities are new to the Samba-3 release:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Windows NT4 domain trusts.
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2870155"></a>
	Adding users via the User Manager for Domains. This can be done on any MS Windows
	client using the <tt class="filename">Nexus.exe</tt> toolkit that is available from Microsoft's Web site.
	Samba-3 supports the use of the Microsoft Management Console for user management.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Introduces replaceable and multiple user account (authentication)
	backends. In the case where the backend is placed in an LDAP database,
	Samba-3 confers the benefits of a backend that can be distributed, replicated
	and is highly scalable.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Implements full Unicode support. This simplifies cross locale internationalization
	support. It also opens up the use of protocols that Samba-2.2.x had but could not use due
	to the need to fully support Unicode.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
The following functionalities are not provided by Samba-3:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2870209"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2870218"></a>
	SAM replication with Windows NT4 Domain Controllers
	(i.e., a Samba PDC and a Windows NT BDC or vice versa). This means Samba 
	cannot operate as a BDC when the PDC is Microsoft-based or 
	replicate account data to Windows BDCs.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Acting as a Windows 2000 Domain Controller (i.e., Kerberos and 
	Active Directory). In point of fact, Samba-3 does have some
	Active Directory Domain Control ability that is at this time
	purely experimental that is certain to change as it becomes a
	fully supported feature some time during the Samba-3 (or later)
	life cycle. However, Active Directory is more then just SMB 
	it's also LDAP, Kerberos, DHCP, and other protocols (with proprietary
	extensions, of course).
	</p></li><li><p>
	The Windows 200x/XP MMC (Computer Management) Console can not be used
	to manage a Samba-3 server. For this you can use only the MS Windows NT4
	Domain Server manager and the MS Windows NT4 Domain User Manager. Both are
	part of the SVRTOOLS.EXE package mentioned later.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
Windows 9x/Me/XP Home clients are not true members of a domain for reasons outlined
in this chapter. The protocol for support of Windows 9x/Me style network (domain) logons
is completely different from NT4/Windows 200x type domain logons and has been officially supported
for some time. These clients use the old LanMan Network Logon facilities that are supported
in Samba since approximately the Samba-1.9.15 series.
</p><p>
Samba-3 implements group mapping between Windows NT groups
and UNIX groups (this is really quite complicated to explain in a short space). This is 
discussed more fully in <link linkend="groupmapping">.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2870290"></a>
Samba-3, like an MS Windows NT4 PDC or a Windows 200x Active Directory, needs to store
user and Machine Trust Account information in a suitable backend datastore. 
Refer to <link linkend="machine-trust-accounts">. With Samba-3 there can be multiple
backends for this. A complete discussion of account database backends can be found in
<link linkend="passdb">.
</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2870321"></a>Basics of Domain Control</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Over the years, public perceptions of what Domain Control really is has taken on an
almost mystical nature. Before we branch into a brief overview of Domain Control,
there are three basic types of Domain Controllers.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2870336"></a>Domain Controller Types</h3></div></div><div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Primary Domain Controller</p></li><li><p>Backup Domain Controller</p></li><li><p>ADS Domain Controller</p></li></ul></div><p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>Primary Domain Controller</em></span> or PDC plays an important role in MS 
Windows NT4. In Windows 200x Domain Control architecture, this role is held by Domain Controllers.
Folklore dictates that because of its role in the MS Windows
network, the Domain Controller should be the most powerful and most capable machine in the network.
As strange as it may seem to say this here, good overall network performance dictates that
the entire infrastructure needs to be balanced. It is advisable to invest more in Stand-alone
(Domain Member) servers than in the Domain Controllers.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2870387"></a>
In the case of MS Windows NT4-style domains, it is the PDC that initiates a new Domain Control database.
This forms a part of the Windows registry called the Security Account Manager (SAM). It plays a key
part in NT4-type domain user authentication and in synchronization of the domain authentication
database with Backup Domain Controllers. 
</p><p>
With MS Windows 200x Server-based Active Directory domains, one Domain Controller initiates a potential
hierarchy of Domain Controllers, each with their own area of delegated control. The master domain
controller has the ability to override any downstream controller, but a downline controller has
control only over its downline. With Samba-3, this functionality can be implemented using an
LDAP-based user and machine account backend.
</p><p>
New to Samba-3 is the ability to use a backend database that holds the same type of data as
the NT4-style SAM database (one of the registry files)<sup>[<a name="id2870421" href="#ftn.id2870421">1</a>]</sup>.
</p><p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>Backup Domain Controller</em></span> or BDC plays a key role in servicing network
authentication requests. The BDC is biased to answer logon requests in preference to the PDC.
On a network segment that has a BDC and a PDC, the BDC will most likely service network
logon requests. The PDC will answer network logon requests when the BDC is too busy (high load).
A BDC can be promoted to a PDC. If the PDC is online at the time that a BDC is promoted to
PDC, the previous PDC is automatically demoted to a BDC. With Samba-3, this is not an automatic
operation; the PDC and BDC must be manually configured and changes also need to be made.
</p><p>
With MS Windows NT4, a decision is made at installation to determine what type of machine the server will be.
It is possible to promote a BDC to a PDC and vice versa. The only way
to convert a Domain Controller to a Domain Member server or a Stand-alone Server is to
reinstall it. The install time choices offered are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Primary Domain Controller</em></span>  the one that seeds the domain SAM.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Backup Domain Controller</em></span>  one that obtains a copy of the domain SAM.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Domain Member Server</em></span>  one that has no copy of the domain SAM, rather it obtains authentication from a Domain Controller for all access controls.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Stand-alone Server</em></span>  one that plays no part is SAM synchronization, has its own authentication database and plays no role in Domain Security.</p></li></ul></div><p>
With MS Windows 2000, the configuration of Domain Control is done after the server has been
installed. Samba-3 is capable of acting fully as a native member of a Windows 200x server
Active Directory domain.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2889012"></a>
New to Samba-3 is the ability to function fully as an MS Windows NT4-style Domain Controller,
excluding the SAM replication components. However, please be aware that Samba-3 also supports the
MS Windows 200x Domain Control protocols.
</p><p>
At this time any appearance that Samba-3 is capable of acting as an
<span class="emphasis"><em>Domain Controller</em></span> in native ADS mode is limited and experimental in nature.
This functionality should not be used until the Samba Team offers formal support for it.
At such a time, the documentation will be revised to duly reflect all configuration and
management requirements. Samba can act as a NT4-style DC in a Windows 2000/XP 
environment. However, there are certain compromises:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>No machine policy files.</li><li>No Group Policy Objects.</li><li>No synchronously executed AD logon scripts.</li><li>Can't use Active Directory management tools to manage users and machines.</li><li>Registry changes tattoo the main registry, while with AD they do not leave permanent changes in effect.</li><li>Without AD you cannot perform the function of exporting specific applications to specific users or groups.</li></ul></div><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2889080"></a>Preparing for Domain Control</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
There are two ways that MS Windows machines may interact with each other, with other servers
and with Domain Controllers: either as <span class="emphasis"><em>Stand-alone</em></span> systems, more commonly
called <span class="emphasis"><em>Workgroup</em></span> members, or as full participants in a security system,
more commonly called <span class="emphasis"><em>Domain</em></span> members.
</p><p>
It should be noted that <span class="emphasis"><em>Workgroup</em></span> membership involves no special configuration
other than the machine being configured so the network configuration has a commonly used name
for its workgroup entry. It is not uncommon for the name WORKGROUP to be used for this. With this
mode of configurationi, there are no Machine Trust Accounts and any concept of membership as such
is limited to the fact that all machines appear in the network neighborhood to be logically
grouped together. Again, just to be clear: <span class="emphasis"><em>workgroup mode does not involve security machine 
accounts</em></span>.
</p><p>
Domain Member machines have a machine account in the Domain accounts database. A special procedure
must be followed on each machine to effect Domain Membership. This procedure, which can be done
only by the local machine Administrator account, will create the Domain machine account (if it does
not exist), and then initializes that account. When the client first logs onto the
Domain it triggers a machine password change.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
When Samba is configured as a Domain Controller, secure network operation demands that
all MS Windows NT4/200x/XP Professional clients should be configured as Domain Members.
If a machine is not made a member of the Domain, then it will operate like a workgroup
(Stand-alone) machine. Please refer to <link linkend="domain-member"> for
information regarding Domain Membership.
</p></div><p>
The following are necessary for configuring Samba-3 as an MS Windows NT4-style PDC for MS Windows
NT4/200x/XP clients:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Configuration of basic TCP/IP and MS Windows networking.</p></li><li><p>Correct designation of the Server Role (<a class="indexterm" name="id2889184"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>security</tt></i> = user).</p></li><li><p>Consistent configuration of Name Resolution<sup>[<a name="id2889204" href="#ftn.id2889204">2</a>]</sup>.</p></li><li><p>Domain logons for Windows NT4/200x/XP Professional clients.</p></li><li><p>Configuration of Roaming Profiles or explicit configuration to force local profile usage.</p></li><li><p>Configuration of network/system policies.</p></li><li><p>Adding and managing domain user accounts.</p></li><li><p>Configuring MS Windows client machines to become Domain Members.</p></li></ul></div><p>
The following provisions are required to serve MS Windows 9x/Me clients:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Configuration of basic TCP/IP and MS Windows networking.</p></li><li><p>Correct designation of the server role (<a class="indexterm" name="id2889279"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>security</tt></i> = user).</p></li><li><p>Network Logon Configuration (since Windows 9x/Me/XP Home are not technically domain

Roaming Profiles and System/Network policies are advanced network administration topics
that are covered in the <link linkend="ProfileMgmt"> and 
<link linkend="PolicyMgmt"> chapters of this document. However, these are not
necessarily specific to a Samba PDC as much as they are related to Windows NT networking concepts.
</p></div><p>
A Domain Controller is an SMB/CIFS server that:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Registers and advertises itself as a Domain Controller (through NetBIOS broadcasts
	as well as by way of name registrations either by Mailslot Broadcasts over UDP broadcast,
	to a WINS server over UDP unicast, or via DNS and Active Directory).
	</p></li><li><p>
	Provides the NETLOGON service. (This is actually a collection of services that runs over
	mulitple protocols. These include the LanMan Logon service, the Netlogon service,
	the Local Security Account service, and variations of them.)
	</p></li><li><p>
	Provides a share called NETLOGON.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
It is rather easy to configure Samba to provide these. Each Samba Domain Controller must provide
the NETLOGON service that Samba calls the <a class="indexterm" name="id2889409"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>domain logons</tt></i> functionality
(after the name of the parameter in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file). Additionally, one server in a Samba-3
Domain must advertise itself as the Domain Master Browser<sup>[<a name="id2889433" href="#ftn.id2889433">3</a>]</sup>.
This causes the Primary Domain Controller to claim a domain-specific NetBIOS name that identifies it as a
Domain Master Browser for its given domain or workgroup. Local master browsers in the same domain or workgroup on
broadcast-isolated subnets then ask for a complete copy of the browse list for the whole wide area network.
Browser clients will then contact their Local Master Browser, and will receive the domain-wide browse list,
instead of just the list for their broadcast-isolated subnet.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2889458"></a>Domain Control  Example Configuration</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The first step in creating a working Samba PDC is to understand the parameters necessary
in <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>. An example <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> for acting as a PDC can be found in <link linkend="pdc-example">.

		Where use of backup Domain Controllers (BDCs) is intended, the only logical choice is

Samba-3 is not, and cannot act as, an Active Directory Server. It cannot truly function as
an Active Directory Primary Domain Controller. The protocols for some of the functionality
of Active Directory Domain Controllers has been partially implemented on an experimental
only basis. Please do not expect Samba-3 to support these protocols. Do not depend
on any such functionality either now or in the future. The Samba Team may remove these
experimental features or may change their behavior. This is mentioned for the benefit of those
who have discovered secret capabilities in Samba-3 and who have asked when this functionality will be
completed. The answer is maybe or maybe never!
</p><p>
To be sure, Samba-3 is designed to provide most of the functionality that Microsoft Windows NT4-style
Domain Controllers have. Samba-3 does not have all the capabilities of Windows NT4, but it does have
a number of features that Windows NT4 domain contollers do not have. In short, Samba-3 is not NT4 and it
is not Windows Server 200x, it is not an Active Directory server. We hope this is plain and simple
enough for all to understand.

To be completely clear: If you want MS Windows XP Home Edition to integrate with your
MS Windows NT4 or Active Directory Domain Security, understand it cannot be done.
The only option is to purchase the upgrade from MS Windows XP Home Edition to
MS Windows XP Professional.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
MS Windows XP Home Edition does not have the ability to join any type of Domain
Security facility. Unlike MS Windows 9x/Me, MS Windows XP Home Edition also completely
lacks the ability to log onto a network.
</p></div><p>
Now that this has been said, please do not ask the mailing list or email any of the
Samba Team members with your questions asking how to make this work. It can't be done.
If it can be done, then to do so would violate your software license agreement with
Microsoft, and we recommend that you do not do that.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2890186"></a>The Special Case of Windows 9x/Me</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
A domain and a workgroup are exactly the same in terms of network
browsing. The difference is that a distributable authentication
database is associated with a domain, for secure login access to a
network. Also, different access rights can be granted to users if they
successfully authenticate against a domain logon server. Samba-3 does this
now in the same way as MS Windows NT/200x.
</p><p>
The SMB client logging on to a domain has an expectation that every other
server in the domain should accept the same authentication information.
Network browsing functionality of domains and workgroups is identical and
is explained in this documentation under the browsing discussions.
It should be noted that browsing is totally orthogonal to logon support.
</p><p>
Issues related to the single-logon network model are discussed in this
section. Samba supports domain logons, network logon scripts and user
profiles for MS Windows for workgroups and MS Windows 9X/ME clients,
which are the focus of this section.
</p><p>
When an SMB client in a domain wishes to logon, it broadcasts requests for a
logon server. The first one to reply gets the job, and validates its
password using whatever mechanism the Samba administrator has installed.
It is possible (but ill advised ) to create a domain where the user
database is not shared between servers, i.e., they are effectively workgroup
servers advertising themselves as participating in a domain. This
demonstrates how authentication is quite different from but closely
involved with domains.
</p><p>
Using these features you can make your clients verify their logon via
the Samba server; make clients run a batch file when they logon to
the network and download their preferences, desktop and start menu.
</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>
MS Windows XP Home edition is not able to join a domain and does not permit
the use of domain logons.
</em></span></p><p>
Before launching into the configuration instructions, it is 
worthwhile to look at how a Windows 9x/Me client performs a logon:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	The client broadcasts (to the IP broadcast address of the subnet it is in)
	a NetLogon request. This is sent to the NetBIOS name DOMAIN&lt;#1c&gt; at the
	NetBIOS layer. The client chooses the first response it receives, which
	contains the NetBIOS name of the logon server to use in the format of 
	<tt class="filename">\\SERVER</tt>.
	</p></li><li><p>
	The client connects to that server, logs on (does an SMBsessetupX) and
	then connects to the IPC$ share (using an SMBtconX).
	</p></li><li><p>
	The client does a NetWkstaUserLogon request, which retrieves the name
	of the user's logon script. 
	</p></li><li><p>
	The client then connects to the NetLogon share and searches for said script.	
	If it is found and can be read, it is retrieved and executed by the client.
	After this, the client disconnects from the NetLogon share.
	</p></li><li><p>
	The client sends a NetUserGetInfo request to the server to retrieve
	the user's home share, which is used to search for profiles. Since the
	response to the NetUserGetInfo request does not contain much more than	
	the user's home share, profiles for Windows 9x clients must reside in the user
	home directory.
	</p></li><li><p>
	The client connects to the user's home share and searches for the 
	user's profile. As it turns out, you can specify the user's home share as
	a sharename and path. For example, <tt class="filename">\\server\fred\.winprofile</tt>.
	If the profiles are found, they are implemented.
	</p></li><li><p>
	The client then disconnects from the user's home share and reconnects to
	the NetLogon share and looks for <tt class="filename">CONFIG.POL</tt>, the policies file. If this is
	found, it is read and implemented.
	</p></li></ol></div><p>
The main difference between a PDC and a Windows 9x/Me logon server configuration is:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Password encryption is not required for a Windows 9x/Me logon server. But note
	that beginning with MS Windows 98 the default setting is that plain-text
	password support is disabled. It can be re-enabled with the registry
	changes that are documented in <link linkend="PolicyMgmt">.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Windows 9x/Me clients do not require and do not use Machine Trust Accounts.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
A Samba PDC will act as a Windows 9x/Me logon server; after all, it does provide the
network logon services that MS Windows 9x/Me expect to find.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
Use of plain-text passwords is strongly discouraged. Where used they are easily detected
using a sniffer tool to examine network traffic.
</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2890439"></a>Security Mode and Master Browsers</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
There are a few comments to make in order to tie up some loose ends. There has been
much debate over the issue of whether it is okay to configure Samba as a Domain
Controller in security modes other than user. The only security mode that will
not work due to technical reasons is share-mode security. Domain and server mode
security are really just a variation on SMB User Level Security.
</p><p>
Actually, this issue is also closely tied to the debate on whether 
Samba must be the Domain Master Browser for its workgroup
when operating as a DC. While it may technically be possible
to configure a server as such (after all, browsing and domain logons
are two distinctly different functions), it is not a good idea to do
so. You should remember that the DC must register the DOMAIN&lt;#1b&gt; NetBIOS 
name. This is the name used by Windows clients to locate the DC.
Windows clients do not distinguish between the DC and the DMB.
A DMB is a Domain Master Browser  see <link linkend="DMB">.
For this reason, it is wise to configure the Samba DC as the DMB.
</p><p>
Now back to the issue of configuring a Samba DC to use a mode other than
<a class="indexterm" name="id2890493"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>security</tt></i> = user. If a Samba host is
configured to use another SMB server or DC in order to validate user connection requests,
it is a fact that some other machine on the network (the <a class="indexterm" name="id2890510"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>password server</tt></i>)
knows more about the user than the Samba host. About 99% of the time, this other host is
a Domain Controller. Now to operate in domain mode security, the <a class="indexterm" name="id2890527"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>workgroup</tt></i>
parameter must be set to the name of the Windows NT domain (which already has a Domain Controller).
If the domain does not already have a Domain Controller, you do not yet have a Domain.
</p><p>
Configuring a Samba box as a DC for a domain that already by definition has a
PDC is asking for trouble. Therefore, you should always configure the Samba DC
to be the DMB for its domain and set <a class="indexterm" name="id2890552"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>security</tt></i> = user.
This is the only officially supported mode of operation.

A machine account, typically stored in <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt>, takes the form of the machine
name with a &#8220;<span class="quote">$</span>&#8221; appended. FreeBSD (and other BSD systems) will not create a user with a

</p><p>
The problem is only in the program used to make the entry. Once made, it works perfectly.
Create a user without the &#8220;<span class="quote">$</span>&#8221;. Then use <b class="command">vipw</b> to edit the entry, adding
the &#8220;<span class="quote">$</span>&#8221;. Or create the whole entry with vipw if you like; make sure you use a unique user login ID.

</p><p>
This happens if you try to create a Machine Trust Account from the machine itself and already have a
connection (e.g., mapped drive) to a share (or IPC$) on the Samba PDC. The following command
will remove all network drive connections:
</p><pre class="screen">

</p><p>
Further, if the machine is already a &#8220;<span class="quote">member of a workgroup</span>&#8221; that 
is the same name as the domain you are joining (bad idea) you will 
get this message. Change the workgroup name to something else, it

</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2890749"></a>
This occurs when the domain SID stored in the secrets.tdb database
is changed. The most common cause of a change in domain SID is when
the domain name and/or the server name (NetBIOS name) is changed.
The only way to correct the problem is to restore the original domain 
SID or remove the domain client from the domain and rejoin. The domain
SID may be reset using either the net or rpcclient utilities.
</p><p>
To reset or change the domain SID you can use the net command as follows:

</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>net getlocalsid 'OLDNAME'</tt></b>
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>net setlocalsid 'SID'</tt></b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Workstation Machine Trust Accounts work only with the Domain (or network) SID. If this SID changes
Domain Members (workstations) will not be able to log onto the domain. The original Domain SID
can be recovered from the secrets.tdb file. The alternative is to visit each workstation to re-join
it to the domain.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2890822"></a>The Machine Trust Account Is Not Accessible</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
&#8220;<span class="quote">When I try to join the domain I get the message, <span class="errorname">`The machine account 
for this computer either does not exist or is not accessible'</span>. What's 
wrong?</span>&#8221;
</p><p>
This problem is caused by the PDC not having a suitable Machine Trust Account. 
If you are using the <a class="indexterm" name="id2890849"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>add machine script</tt></i> method to create 
accounts then this would indicate that it has not worked. Ensure the domain 
admin user system is working.
</p><p>
Alternately, if you are creating account entries manually then they 
have not been created correctly. Make sure that you have the entry 
correct for the Machine Trust Account in <tt class="filename">smbpasswd</tt> file on the Samba PDC. 
If you added the account using an editor rather than using the smbpasswd 
utility, make sure that the account name is the machine NetBIOS name 
with a &#8220;<span class="quote">$</span>&#8221; appended to it (i.e., computer_name$). There must be an entry 
in both /etc/passwd and the smbpasswd file.
</p><p>
Some people have also reported that inconsistent subnet masks between the Samba server and the NT 
client can cause this problem.  Make sure that these are consistent for both client and server.

<a class="indexterm" name="id2890966"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2890975"></a>
After successfully joining the domain, user logons fail with one of two messages: one to the
effect that the Domain Controller cannot be found; the other claims that the account does not
exist in the domain or that the password is incorrect. This may be due to incompatible
settings between the Windows client and the Samba-3 server for <span class="emphasis"><em>schannel</em></span>
(secure channel) settings or <span class="emphasis"><em>smb signing</em></span> settings. Check your Samba
settings for <span class="emphasis"><em> client schannel, server schannel, client signing, server signing</em></span>
by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<b class="command">testparm -v | more</b> and looking for the value of these parameters.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Also use the Microsoft Management Console  Local Security Settings. This tool is available from the
Control Panel. The Policy settings are found in the Local Policies/Securty Options area and are prefixed by
<span class="emphasis"><em>Secure Channel: ..., and Digitally sign ....</em></span>.
</p><p>
It is important that these be set consistently with the Samba-3 server settings.
