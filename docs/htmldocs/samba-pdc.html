>Versions of Samba prior to release 2.2 had marginal capabilities to act
as a Windows NT 4.0 Primary Domain Controller

(PDC).  With Samba 2.2.0, we are proud to announce official support for
Windows NT 4.0-style domain logons from Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 
2000 clients.  This article outlines the steps
necessary for configuring Samba as a PDC.  It is necessary to have a
working Samba server prior to implementing the PDC functionality.  If
you have not followed the steps outlined in <A
HREF="UNIX_INSTALL.html"
TARGET="_top"

that your server is configured correctly before proceeding.  Another
good resource in the <A

Domain</H1
><P
>A machine trust account is a Samba account that is used to
authenticate a client machine (rather than a user) to the Samba
server.  In Windows terminology, this is known as a "Computer
Account."</P
><P
>The password of a machine trust account acts as the shared secret for
secure communication with the Domain Controller.  This is a security
feature to prevent an unauthorized machine with the same NetBIOS name
from joining the domain and gaining access to domain user/group
accounts.  Windows NT and 2000 clients use machine trust accounts, but
Windows 9x clients do not.  Hence, a Windows 9x client is never a true
member of a domain because it does not possess a machine trust
account, and thus has no shared secret with the domain controller.</P
><P
>A Windows PDC stores each machine trust account in the Windows
Registry.  A Samba PDC, however, stores each machine trust account 
in two parts, as follows:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>A Samba account, stored in the same location as user
    LanMan and NT password hashes (currently
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smbpasswd</TT
>). The Samba account 
    possesses and uses only the NT password hash.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A corresponding Unix account, typically stored in
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT

    create <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> entries.) </P

	Unix account are created by hand.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> "On-the-fly" creation. The Samba machine trust
	account is automatically created by Samba at the time the client
	is joined to the domain. (For security, this is the
	recommended method.) The corresponding Unix account may be
	created automatically or manually. </P

name of the client to be joined to the domain.  The "$" must be

this as a machine trust account.</P

	You can use the -d option for both smbd and nmbd to specify what 
	'debug level' at which to run.  See the man pages on smbd, nmbd  and 
	smb.conf for more information on debugging options.  The debug 
	level can range from 1 (the default) to 10 (100 for debugging passwords).
	</P

>	Another helpful method of debugging is to compile samba using the 
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc -g </B
> flag.   This will include debug 
	information in the binaries and allow you to attach gdb to the 
	running smbd / nmbd process.  In order to attach gdb to an smbd 
	process for an NT workstation, first get the workstation to make the 
	connection. Pressing ctrl-alt-delete and going down to the domain box 
	is sufficient (at least, on the first time you join the domain) to 
	generate a 'LsaEnumTrustedDomains'. Thereafter, the workstation 
	maintains an open connection, and therefore there will be an smbd 
	process running (assuming that you haven't set a really short smbd 
	idle timeout)  So, in between pressing ctrl alt delete, and actually 
	typing in your password, you can gdb attach and continue.

>A domain and a workgroup are exactly the same thing in terms of network
browsing.  The difference is that a distributable authentication
database is associated with a domain, for secure login access to a
network.  Also, different access rights can be granted to users if they
successfully authenticate against a domain logon server (NT server and 
other systems based on NT server support this, as does at least Samba TNG now).</P
><P
>The SMB client logging on to a domain has an expectation that every other
server in the domain should accept the same authentication information.
Network browsing functionality of domains and workgroups is
identical and is explained in BROWSING.txt. It should be noted, that browsing
is totally orthogonal to logon support.</P
><P
>Issues related to the single-logon network model are discussed in this
section.  Samba supports domain logons, network logon scripts, and user
profiles for MS Windows for workgroups and MS Windows 9X/ME clients
which will be the focus of this section.</P
><P
>When an SMB client in a domain wishes to logon it broadcast requests for a
logon server.  The first one to reply gets the job, and validates its
password using whatever mechanism the Samba administrator has installed.
It is possible (but very stupid) to create a domain where the user
database is not shared between servers, i.e. they are effectively workgroup
servers advertising themselves as participating in a domain.  This
demonstrates how authentication is quite different from but closely
involved with domains.</P
><P
>Using these features you can make your clients verify their logon via
the Samba server; make clients run a batch file when they logon to
the network and download their preferences, desktop and start menu.</P

>Before launching into the configuration instructions, it is 
worthwhile lookingat how a Windows 9x/ME client performs a logon:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>	The client broadcasts (to the IP broadcast address of the subnet it is in)
	a NetLogon request. This is sent to the NetBIOS name DOMAIN&#60;1c&#62; at the
	NetBIOS layer.  The client chooses the first response it receives, which
	contains the NetBIOS name of the logon server to use in the format of 
	\\SERVER.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to that server, logs on (does an SMBsessetupX) and
	then connects to the IPC$ share (using an SMBtconX).
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then does a NetWkstaUserLogon request, which retrieves the name
	of the user's logon script. 
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to the NetLogon share and searches for this 	
	and if it is found and can be read, is retrieved and executed by the client.
	After this, the client disconnects from the NetLogon share.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then sends a NetUserGetInfo request to the server, to retrieve
	the user's home share, which is used to search for profiles. Since the
	response to the NetUserGetInfo request does not contain much more 	
	the user's home share, profiles for Win9X clients MUST reside in the user
	home directory.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to the user's home share and searches for the

mode security.  <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"

>
mode security is really just a variation on SMB user level security.</P
><P
>Actually, this issue is also closely tied to the debate on whether 
or not Samba must be the domain master browser for its workgroup
when operating as a DC.  While it may technically be possible
to configure a server as such (after all, browsing and domain logons
are two distinctly different functions), it is not a good idea to
so.  You should remember that the DC must register the DOMAIN#1b NetBIOS 
name.  This is the name used by Windows clients to locate the DC.
Windows clients do not distinguish between the DC and the DMB.
For this reason, it is very wise to configure the Samba DC as the DMB.</P
><P
>Now back to the issue of configuring a Samba DC to use a mode other
than "security = user".  If a Samba host is configured to use 
another SMB server or DC in order to validate user connection 
requests, then it is a fact that some other machine on the network 
(the "password server") knows more about user than the Samba host.
99% of the time, this other host is a domain controller.  Now

The term "Domain Controller" and those related to it refer to one specific
method of authentication that can underly an SMB domain. Domain Controllers
prior to Windows NT Server 3.1 were sold by various companies and based on 
private extensions to the LAN Manager 2.1 protocol. Windows NT introduced
Microsoft-specific ways of distributing the user authentication database.
See DOMAIN.txt for examples of how Samba can participate in or create
SMB domains based on shared authentication database schemes other than the 
Windows NT SAM.</P
><P
>Windows NT Server can be installed as either a plain file and print server
(WORKGROUP workstation or server) or as a server that participates in Domain
Control (DOMAIN member, Primary Domain controller or Backup Domain controller).
The same is true for OS/2 Warp Server, Digital Pathworks and other similar
products, all of which can participate in Domain Control along with Windows NT.</P
><P
>To many people these terms can be confusing, so let's try to clear the air.</P
><P
>Every Windows NT system (workstation or server) has a registry database.
The registry contains entries that describe the initialization information
for all services (the equivalent of Unix Daemons) that run within the Windows
NT environment. The registry also contains entries that tell application
software where to find dynamically loadable libraries that they depend upon.
In fact, the registry contains entries that describes everything that anything
may need to know to interact with the rest of the system.</P
><P
>The registry files can be located on any Windows NT machine by opening a
command prompt and typing:</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>C:\WINNT\&#62;</TT
> dir %SystemRoot%\System32\config</P
><P
>The environment variable %SystemRoot% value can be obtained by typing:</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>C:\WINNT&#62;</TT
>echo %SystemRoot%</P
><P
>The active parts of the registry that you may want to be familiar with are
the files called: default, system, software, sam and security.</P
><P
>In a domain environment, Microsoft Windows NT domain controllers participate
in replication of the SAM and SECURITY files so that all controllers within
the domain have an exactly identical copy of each.</P
><P
>The Microsoft Windows NT system is structured within a security model that
says that all applications and services must authenticate themselves before
they can obtain permission from the security manager to do what they set out
to do.</P
><P
>The Windows NT User database also resides within the registry. This part of
the registry contains the user's security identifier, home directory, group
memberships, desktop profile, and so on.</P
><P
>Every Windows NT system (workstation as well as server) will have its own
registry. Windows NT Servers that participate in Domain Security control
have a database that they share in common - thus they do NOT own an
independent full registry database of their own, as do Workstations and
plain Servers.</P
><P
>The User database is called the SAM (Security Access Manager) database and
is used for all user authentication as well as for authentication of inter-
process authentication (i.e. to ensure that the service action a user has
requested is permitted within the limits of that user's privileges).</P
><P
>The Samba team have produced a utility that can dump the Windows NT SAM into 
smbpasswd format: see ENCRYPTION.txt for information on smbpasswd and
/pub/samba/pwdump on your nearest Samba mirror for the utility. This 
facility is useful but cannot be easily used to implement SAM replication
to Samba systems.</P
><P
>Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT Workstations and Servers
can participate in a Domain security system that is controlled by Windows NT
servers that have been correctly configured. Almost every domain will have
ONE Primary Domain Controller (PDC). It is desirable that each domain will
have at least one Backup Domain Controller (BDC).</P
><P
>The PDC and BDCs then participate in replication of the SAM database so that
each Domain Controlling participant will have an up to date SAM component
within its registry.</P
