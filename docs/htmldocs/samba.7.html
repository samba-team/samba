>DESCRIPTION</H2
><P
>The Samba software suite is a collection of programs 
	that implements the Server Message Block (commonly abbreviated 
	as SMB) protocol for UNIX systems. This protocol is sometimes 
	also referred to as the Common Internet File System (CIFS). For a
	more thorough description, see <A
HREF="http://www.ubiqx.org/cifs/"
TARGET="_top"
>	http://www.ubiqx.org/cifs/</A
>. Samba also implements the NetBIOS
	protocol in nmbd.</P

>COMPONENTS</H2
><P
>The Samba suite is made up of several components. Each 
	component is described in a separate manual page. It is strongly 
	recommended that you read the documentation that comes with Samba 
	and the manual pages of those components that you use. If the 
	manual pages and documents aren't clear enough then please visit
	<A

>http://devel.samba.org</A
>
	for information on how to file a bug report or submit a patch.</P
><P
>If you require help, visit the Samba webpage at
	<A
HREF="http://samba.org/"

>CONTRIBUTORS</H2
><P
>Contributors to the project are now too numerous 
	to mention here but all deserve the thanks of all Samba 
	users. To see a full list, look at <A
HREF="ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/change-log"
TARGET="_top"
>	ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/change-log</A
>
	for the pre-CVS changes and at <A
HREF="ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/cvs.log"
TARGET="_top"
>	ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/cvs.log</A
>
	for the contributors to Samba post-CVS. CVS is the Open Source 
	source code control system used by the Samba Team to develop 
	Samba. The project would have been unmanageable without it.</P
><P
>In addition, several commercial organizations now help 
	fund the Samba Team with money and equipment. For details see 
	the Samba Web pages at <A

><P
>The original Samba software and related utilities 
	were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
	by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
	to the way the Linux kernel is developed.</P
><P
>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
	The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
	excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
	<A
HREF="ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/"
TARGET="_top"
>	ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/</A
>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
	release by Jeremy Allison.  The conversion to DocBook for 
	Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter</P
