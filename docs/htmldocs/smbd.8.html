	provides filesharing and printing services to Windows clients. 
	The server provides filespace and printer services to
	clients using the SMB (or CIFS) protocol. This is compatible 
	with the LanManager protocol, and can service LanManager 
	clients.  These include MSCLIENT 3.0 for DOS, Windows for 
	Workgroups, Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, 
	OS/2, DAVE for Macintosh, and smbfs for Linux.</p><p>An extensive description of the services that the 
	server can provide is given in the man page for the 
	configuration file controlling the attributes of those 
	services (see <a href="smb.conf.5.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">smb.conf</span>(5)</span></a>.  This man page will not describe the 
	services, but will concentrate on the administrative aspects 
	of running the server.</p><p>Please note that there are significant security 
	implications to running this server, and the <a href="smb.conf.5.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">smb.conf</span>(5)</span></a> manual page should be regarded as mandatory reading before 
	proceeding with installation.</p><p>A session is created whenever a client requests one. 
	Each client gets a copy of the server for each session. This 
	copy then services all connections made by the client during 
	that session. When all connections from its client are closed, 
	the copy of the server for that client terminates.</p><p>The configuration file, and any files that it includes, 
	are automatically reloaded every minute, if they change.  You 
	can force a reload by sending a SIGHUP to the server.  Reloading 
	the configuration file will not affect connections to any service 
	that is already established.  Either the user will have to 
	disconnect from the service, or <b class="command">smbd</b> killed and restarted.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><h2>OPTIONS</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">-D</span></dt><dd><p>If specified, this parameter causes 
		the server to operate as a daemon. That is, it detaches 
		itself and runs in the background, fielding requests 
		on the appropriate port. Operating the server as a
		daemon is the recommended way of running <b class="command">smbd</b> for 
		servers that provide more than casual use file and 
		print services.  This switch is assumed if <b class="command">smbd
		</b> is executed on the command line of a shell.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-F</span></dt><dd><p>If specified, this parameter causes
		the main <b class="command">smbd</b> process to not daemonize,
		i.e. double-fork and disassociate with the terminal.
		Child processes are still created as normal to service
		each connection request, but the main process does not
		exit. This operation mode is suitable for running
		<b class="command">smbd</b> under process supervisors such
		as <b class="command">supervise</b> and <b class="command">svscan</b>
		from Daniel J. Bernstein's <b class="command">daemontools</b>
		package, or the AIX process monitor.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-S</span></dt><dd><p>If specified, this parameter causes
		<b class="command">smbd</b> to log to standard output rather
		than a file.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-i</span></dt><dd><p>If this parameter is specified it causes the
		server to run &quot;interactively&quot;, not as a daemon, even if the
		server is executed on the command line of a shell. Setting this
		parameter negates the implicit deamon mode when run from the
		command line. <b class="command">smbd</b> also logs to standard
		output, as if the <b class="command">-S</b> parameter had been
		given.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-V</span></dt><dd><p>Prints the version number for 
<b class="command">smbd</b>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-s &lt;configuration file&gt;</span></dt><dd><p>The file specified contains the 
configuration details required by the server.  The 
information in this file includes server-specific
information such as what printcap file to use, as well 
as descriptions of all the services that the server is 
to provide. See <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> for more information.
The default configuration file name is determined at 
compile time.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-d|--debug=debuglevel</span></dt><dd><p><i class="replaceable"><tt>debuglevel</tt></i> is an integer 
from 0 to 10.  The default value if this parameter is 
not specified is zero.</p><p>The higher this value, the more detail will be 
logged to the log files about the activities of the 
server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious 
warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for
day to day running - it generates a small amount of 
information about operations carried out.</p><p>Levels above 1 will generate considerable 
amounts of log data, and should only be used when 
investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for 
use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
data, most of which is extremely cryptic.</p><p>Note that specifying this parameter here will

		value.  The default value if this parameter is not 
		specified is 139.</p><p>This number is the port number that will be 
		used when making connections to the server from client 
		software. The standard (well-known) port number for the 
		SMB over TCP is 139, hence the default. If you wish to 
		run the server as an ordinary user rather than
		as root, most systems will require you to use a port 
		number greater than 1024 - ask your system administrator 
		for help if you are in this situation.</p><p>In order for the server to be useful by most 
		clients, should you configure it on a port other 
		than 139, you will require port redirection services 
		on port 139, details of which are outlined in rfc1002.txt 
		section 4.3.5.</p><p>This parameter is not normally specified except

	to root after a setuid() call.  Such systems are called 
	trapdoor uid systems. If you have such a system, 
	you will be unable to connect from a client (such as a PC) as 
	two different users at once. Attempts to connect the
	second user will result in access denied or 
	similar.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><tt class="envar">PRINTER</tt></span></dt><dd><p>If no printer name is specified to

		is not specific to the server, however.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><h2>PAM INTERACTION</h2><p>Samba uses PAM for authentication (when presented with a plaintext 
	password), for account checking (is this account disabled?) and for
	session management.  The degree too which samba supports PAM is restricted
	by the limitations of the SMB protocol and the <a class="indexterm" name="id2797347"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>obey pam restrictions</tt></i> <a href="smb.conf.5.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">smb.conf</span>(5)</span></a> paramater.  When this is set, the following restrictions apply:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Account Validation</em></span>:  All accesses to a 
	samba server are checked 
	against PAM to see if the account is vaild, not disabled and is permitted to 
	login at this time.  This also applies to encrypted logins.
	</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Session Management</em></span>:  When not using share 
	level secuirty, users must pass PAM's session checks before access 
	is granted.  Note however, that this is bypassed in share level secuirty.  
	Note also that some older pam configuration files may need a line 
	added for session support. 
	</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><h2>VERSION</h2><p>This man page is correct for version 3.0 of 
	the Samba suite.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2><p>Most diagnostics issued by the server are logged 
	in a specified log file. The log file name is specified 
	at compile time, but may be overridden on the command line.</p><p>The number and nature of diagnostics available depends 
	on the debug level used by the server. If you have problems, set 
	the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files.</p><p>Most messages are reasonably self-explanatory. Unfortunately, 
	at the time this man page was created, there are too many diagnostics 
	available in the source code to warrant describing each and every 
	diagnostic. At this stage your best bet is still to grep the 
	source code and inspect the conditions that gave rise to the 
	diagnostics you are seeing.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><h2>SIGNALS</h2><p>Sending the <b class="command">smbd</b> a SIGHUP will cause it to 
	reload its <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> configuration 
	file within a short period of time.</p><p>To shut down a user's <b class="command">smbd</b> process it is recommended 
	that <b class="command">SIGKILL (-9)</b> <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> 
	be used, except as a last resort, as this may leave the shared
	memory area in an inconsistent state. The safe way to terminate 
	an <b class="command">smbd</b> is to send it a SIGTERM (-15) signal and wait for 
	it to die on its own.</p><p>The debug log level of <b class="command">smbd</b> may be raised
	or lowered using <a href="smbcontrol.1.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">smbcontrol</span>(1)</span></a> program (SIGUSR[1|2] signals are no longer 
	used since Samba 2.2). This is to allow transient problems to be diagnosed, 
	whilst still running at a normally low log level.</p><p>Note that as the signal handlers send a debug write, 
	they are not re-entrant in <b class="command">smbd</b>. This you should wait until 
	<b class="command">smbd</b> is in a state of waiting for an incoming SMB before 
	issuing them. It is possible to make the signal handlers safe 
	by un-blocking the signals before the select call and re-blocking 
	them after, however this would affect performance.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><h2>SEE ALSO</h2><p><a href="hosts_access.5.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">hosts_access</span>(5)</span></a>, <a href="inetd.8.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">inetd</span>(8)</span></a>, <a href="nmbd.8.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">nmbd</span>(8)</span></a>, <a href="smb.conf.5.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">smb.conf</span>(5)</span></a>, <a href="smbclient.1.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">smbclient</span>(1)</span></a>, <a href="testparm.1.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">testparm</span>(1)</span></a>, <a href="testprns.1.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">testprns</span>(1)</span></a>, and the
