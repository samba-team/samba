>DESCRIPTION</H2
><P
>This program is part of the Samba suite.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbd</B
> is the server daemon that 
	provides filesharing and printing services to Windows clients. 
	The server provides filespace and printer services to
	clients using the SMB (or CIFS) protocol. This is compatible 
	with the LanManager protocol, and can service LanManager 
	clients.  These include MSCLIENT 3.0 for DOS, Windows for 
	Workgroups, Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, 
	OS/2, DAVE for Macintosh, and smbfs for Linux.</P
><P
>An extensive description of the services that the 
	server can provide is given in the man page for the 
	configuration file controlling the attributes of those 
	services (see <A
HREF="smb.conf.5.html"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf(5)
	</TT
></A
>.  This man page will not describe the 
	services, but will concentrate on the administrative aspects 
	of running the server.</P
><P
>Please note that there are significant security 
	implications to running this server, and the <A
HREF="smb.conf.5.html"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf(5)</TT
></A
> 
	manpage should be regarded as mandatory reading before 
	proceeding with installation.</P
><P
>A session is created whenever a client requests one. 
	Each client gets a copy of the server for each session. This 
	copy then services all connections made by the client during 
	that session. When all connections from its client are closed, 
	the copy of the server for that client terminates.</P
><P
>The configuration file, and any files that it includes, 
	are automatically reloaded every minute, if they change.  You 
	can force a reload by sending a SIGHUP to the server.  Reloading 
	the configuration file will not affect connections to any service 
	that is already established.  Either the user will have to 
	disconnect from the service, or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbd</B
> killed and restarted.</P

>PAM INTERACTION</H2
><P
>Samba uses PAM for authentication (when presented with a plaintext 
	password), for account checking (is this account disabled?) and for
	session management.  The degree too which samba supports PAM is restricted
	by the limitations of the SMB protocol and the 
	<A

TARGET="_top"
>obey pam restricions</A
>
	smb.conf paramater.  When this is set, the following restrictions apply:
	</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
><EM
>Account Validation</EM
>:  All acccesses to a 
	samba server are checked 
	against PAM to see if the account is vaild, not disabled and is permitted to 
	login at this time.  This also applies to encrypted logins.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Session Management</EM
>:  When not using share 
	level secuirty, users must pass PAM's session checks before access 
	is granted.  Note however, that this is bypassed in share level secuirty.  
	Note also that some older pam configuration files may need a line 
	added for session support.

>The number and nature of diagnostics available depends 
	on the debug level used by the server. If you have problems, set 
	the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files.</P
><P
>Most messages are reasonably self-explanatory. Unfortunately, 
	at the time this man page was created, there are too many diagnostics 
	available in the source code to warrant describing each and every 
	diagnostic. At this stage your best bet is still to grep the 
	source code and inspect the conditions that gave rise to the 
	diagnostics you are seeing.</P
