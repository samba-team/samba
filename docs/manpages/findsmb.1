.SH NAME
findsmb \- list info about machines that respond to SMB  name queries on a subnet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBfindsmb\fR [ \fBsubnet broadcast address\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This perl script is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
\fBfindsmb\fR is a perl script that
prints out several pieces of information about machines 
on a subnet that respond to SMB name query requests.
It uses \fB nmblookup(1)\fRto obtain this information.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBsubnet broadcast address\fR
Without this option, \fBfindsmb
\fRwill probe the subnet of the machine where 
\fBfindsmb\fR is run. This value is passed 
to \fBnmblookup\fR as part of the 
-B option
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The output of \fBfindsmb\fR lists the following 
information for all machines that respond to the initial 
\fBnmblookup\fR for any name: IP address, NetBIOS name, 
Workgroup name, operating system, and SMB server version.
.PP
There will be a '+' in front of the workgroup name for 
machines that are local master browsers for that workgroup. There 
will be an '*' in front of the workgroup name for 
machines that are the domain master browser for that workgroup. 
Machines that are running Windows, Windows 95 or Windows 98 will 
not show any information about the operating system or server 
version.
.PP
The command must be run on a system without \fBnmbd\fRrunning. 
If \fBnmbd\fR is running on the system, you will 
only get the IP address and the DNS name of the machine. To 
get proper responses from Windows 95 and Windows 98 machines, 
the command must be run as root. 
.PP
For example running \fBfindsmb\fR on a machine 
without \fBnmbd\fR running would yield output similar
to the following
.sp
.nf

.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

\fR
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
