.TH "MAKE_SMBCODEPAGE" "1" "02 May 2002" "" ""
.SH NAME
make_smbcodepage \- construct a codepage file for Samba
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmake_smbcodepage\fR \fBc|d\fR \fBcodepage\fR \fBinputfile\fR \fBoutputfile\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
\fBmake_smbcodepage\fR compiles or de-compiles 
codepage files for use with the internationalization features 
of Samba 2.2
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBc|d\fR
This tells \fBmake_smbcodepage\fR 
if it is compiling (\fIc\fR) a text format code 
page file to binary, or (\fId\fR) de-compiling 
a binary codepage file to text. 
.TP
\fBcodepage\fR
This is the codepage we are processing (a 
number, e.g. 850). 
.TP
\fBinputfile\fR
This is the input file to process. In 
the \fIc\fR case this will be a text 
codepage definition file such as the ones found in the Samba 
\fIsource/codepages\fR directory. In
the \fId\fR case this will be the 
binary format codepage definition file normally found in 
the \fIlib/codepages\fR directory in the 
Samba install directory path.
.TP
\fBoutputfile\fR
This is the output file to produce.
.SH "SAMBA CODEPAGE FILES"
.PP
A text Samba codepage definition file is a description 
that tells Samba how to map from upper to lower case for 
characters greater than ascii 127 in the specified DOS code page. 
Note that for certain DOS codepages (437 for example) mapping 
from lower to upper case may be non-symmetrical. For example, in
code page 437 lower case a acute maps to a plain upper case A 
when going from lower to upper case, but plain upper case A maps 
to plain lower case a when lower casing a character. 
.PP
A binary Samba codepage definition file is a binary 
representation of the same information, including a value that
specifies what codepage this file is describing. 
.PP
As Samba does not yet use UNICODE (current for Samba version 2.2) 
you must specify the client code page that your DOS and Windows 
clients are using if you wish to have case insensitivity done 
correctly for your particular language. The default codepage Samba 
uses is 850 (Western European). Text codepage definition sample files
are provided in the Samba distribution for codepages 437 (USA), 737 (Greek),
850 (Western European) 852 (MS-DOS Latin 2), 861 (Icelandic), 866 (Cyrillic),
932 (Kanji SJIS), 936 (Simplified Chinese), 949 (Hangul) and 950 (Traditional
Chinese). Users are encouraged to write text codepage definition files for
their own code pages and donate them to samba@samba.org. All codepage files
in the Samba \fIsource/codepages\fR directory are 
compiled and installed when a \fB'make install'\fR 
command is issued there. 
.PP
The client codepage used by the \fBsmbd\fR server 
is configured using the \fBclient code page\fR parameter 
in the \fBsmb.conf\fR file. 
.SH "FILES"
.PP
\fBcodepage_def.<codepage>\fR
.PP
These are the input (text) codepage files provided in the 
Samba \fIsource/codepages\fR directory.
.PP
A text codepage definition file consists of multiple lines 
containing four fields. These fields are:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBlower\fR: which is the 
(hex) lower case character mapped on this line.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBupper\fR: which is the (hex) 
upper case character that the lower case character will map to.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBmap upper to lower\fR which 
is a boolean value (put either True or False here) which tells 
Samba if it is to map the given upper case character to the 
given lower case character when lower casing a filename.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBmap lower to upper\fR which 
is a boolean value (put either True or False here) which tells 
Samba if it is to map the given lower case character to the 
given upper case character when upper casing a filename.
.PP
\fBcodepage.<codepage>\fR - These are the 
output (binary) codepage files produced and placed in the Samba 
destination \fIlib/codepage\fR directory. 
.PP
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.PP
The location of the server and its support files is a 
matter for individual system administrators. The following are 
thus suggestions only. 
.PP
It is recommended that the \fBmake_smbcodepage
\fRprogram be installed under the \fI/usr/local/samba
\fRhierarchy, in a directory readable by all, writeable 
only by root. The program itself should be executable by all. The 
program should NOT be setuid or setgid! 
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBsmbd(8)\fR, 
smb.conf(5)
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
