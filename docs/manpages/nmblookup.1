.SH NAME
nmblookup \- NetBIOS over TCP/IP client used to lookup NetBIOS names
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
\fBnmblookup\fR [-M] [-R] [-S] [-r] [-A] [-h] [-B <broadcast address>] [-U <unicast
          address>] [-d <debug level>] [-s <smb config file>] [-i <NetBIOS scope>]
          [-T] [-f] {name}

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite\&.

.PP
\fBnmblookup\fR is used to query NetBIOS names and map them to IP addresses in a network using NetBIOS over TCP/IP queries\&. The options allow the name queries to be directed at a particular IP broadcast area or to a particular machine\&. All queries are done over UDP\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
-M
Searches for a master browser by looking up the NetBIOS name \fIname\fR with a type of \fB0x1d\fR\&. If \fI name\fR is "-" then it does a lookup on the special name \fB__MSBROWSE__\fR\&. Please note that in order to use the name "-", you need to make sure "-" isn't parsed as an argument, e\&.g\&. use : \fBnmblookup -M -- -\fR\&.


.TP
-R
Set the recursion desired bit in the packet to do a recursive lookup\&. This is used when sending a name query to a machine running a WINS server and the user wishes to query the names in the WINS server\&. If this bit is unset the normal (broadcast responding) NetBIOS processing code on a machine is used instead\&. See RFC1001, RFC1002 for details\&.


.TP
-S
Once the name query has returned an IP address then do a node status query as well\&. A node status query returns the NetBIOS names registered by a host\&.


.TP
-r
Try and bind to UDP port 137 to send and receive UDP datagrams\&. The reason for this option is a bug in Windows 95 where it ignores the source port of the requesting packet and only replies to UDP port 137\&. Unfortunately, on most UNIX systems root privilege is needed to bind to this port, and in addition, if the \fBnmbd\fR(8) daemon is running on this machine it also binds to this port\&.


.TP
-A
Interpret \fIname\fR as an IP Address and do a node status query on this address\&.


.TP
-n <primary NetBIOS name>
This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself\&. This is identical to setting the \fInetbios name\fR parameter in the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR file\&. However, a command line setting will take precedence over settings in \fIsmb\&.conf\fR\&.


.TP
-i <scope>
This specifies a NetBIOS scope that \fBnmblookup\fR will use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names\&. For details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001\&.txt and rfc1002\&.txt\&. NetBIOS scopes are \fBvery\fR rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you communicate with\&.


.TP
-W|--workgroup=domain
Set the SMB domain of the username\&. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in smb\&.conf\&. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the client to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM)\&.


.TP
-O socket options
TCP socket options to set on the client socket\&. See the socket options parameter in the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR manual page for the list of valid options\&.


.TP
-h|--help
Print a summary of command line options\&.


.TP
-B <broadcast address>
Send the query to the given broadcast address\&. Without this option the default behavior of nmblookup is to send the query to the broadcast address of the network interfaces as either auto-detected or defined in the \fIinterfaces\fR parameter of the \fBsmb.conf\fR(5) file\&.


.TP
-U <unicast address>
Do a unicast query to the specified address or host \fIunicast address\fR\&. This option (along with the \fI-R\fR option) is needed to query a WINS server\&.


.TP
-V
Prints the version number for \fBsmbd\fR\&.


.TP
-s <configuration file>
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See \fIsmb\&.conf\fR for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.


.TP
-d|--debug=debuglevel
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer from 0 to 10\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero\&.


The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\&. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day to day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\&.


Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.


Note that specifying this parameter here will override the \fIlog level\fR parameter in the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR file\&.


.TP
-l|--logfile=logbasename
File name for log/debug files\&. The extension \fB"\&.client"\fR will be appended\&. The log file is never removed by the client\&.


.TP
-T
This causes any IP addresses found in the lookup to be looked up via a reverse DNS lookup into a DNS name, and printed out before each


\fBIP address \&.\&.\&.\&. NetBIOS name\fR


pair that is the normal output\&.


.TP
-f
Show which flags apply to the name that has been looked up\&. Possible answers are zero or more of: Response, Authoritative, Truncated, Recursion_Desired, Recursion_Available, Broadcast\&.


.TP
name
This is the NetBIOS name being queried\&. Depending upon the previous options this may be a NetBIOS name or IP address\&. If a NetBIOS name then the different name types may be specified by appending '#<type>' to the name\&. This name may also be '*', which will return all registered names within a broadcast area\&.


.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP
\fBnmblookup\fR can be used to query a WINS server (in the same way \fBnslookup\fR is used to query DNS servers)\&. To query a WINS server, \fBnmblookup\fR must be called like this:

.PP
\fBnmblookup -U server -R 'name'\fR

.PP
For example, running :

.PP
\fBnmblookup -U samba.org -R 'IRIX#1B'\fR

.PP
would query the WINS server samba\&.org for the domain master browser (1B name type) for the IRIX workgroup\&.

.SH "VERSION"

.PP
This man page is correct for version 3\&.0 of the Samba suite\&.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.PP
\fBnmbd\fR(8), \fBsamba\fR(7), and \fBsmb.conf\fR(5)\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.

.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
