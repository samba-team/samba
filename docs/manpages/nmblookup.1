.SH NAME
nmblookup \- NetBIOS over TCP/IP client used to lookup NetBIOS  names
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBnmblookup\fR [ \fB-M\fR ] [ \fB-R\fR ] [ \fB-S\fR ] [ \fB-r\fR ] [ \fB-A\fR ] [ \fB-h\fR ] [ \fB-B <broadcast address>\fR ] [ \fB-U <unicast address>\fR ] [ \fB-d <debug level>\fR ] [ \fB-s <smb config file>\fR ] [ \fB-i <NetBIOS scope>\fR ] [ \fB-T\fR ] [ \fB-f\fR ] \fBname\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite.
.PP
\fBnmblookup\fR is used to query NetBIOS names 
and map them to IP addresses in a network using NetBIOS over TCP/IP 
queries. The options allow the name queries to be directed at a 
particular IP broadcast area or to a particular machine. All queries 
are done over UDP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-M\fR
Searches for a master browser by looking 
up the  NetBIOS name \fIname\fR with a 
type of 0x1d. If \fI  name\fR is "-" then it does a lookup on the special name 
__MSBROWSE__.
.TP
\fB-R\fR
Set the recursion desired bit in the packet 
to do a recursive lookup. This is used when sending a name 
query to a machine running a WINS server and the user wishes 
to query the names in the WINS server.  If this bit is unset 
the normal (broadcast responding) NetBIOS processing code 
on a machine is used instead. See RFC1001, RFC1002 for details.
.TP
\fB-S\fR
Once the name query has returned an IP 
address then do a node status query as well. A node status 
query returns the NetBIOS names registered by a host.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Try and bind to UDP port 137 to send and receive UDP
datagrams. The reason for this option is a bug in Windows 95 
where it ignores the source port of the requesting packet 
and only replies to UDP port 137. Unfortunately, on most UNIX 
systems root privilege is needed to bind to this port, and 
in addition, if the \fBnmbd\fR(8) daemon is running on this machine it also binds to this port.
.TP
\fB-A\fR
Interpret \fIname\fR as 
an IP Address and do a node status query on this address.
.TP
\fB-n <primary NetBIOS name>\fR
This option allows you to override
the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself. This is identical
to setting the \fINetBIOS
name\fR parameter in the \fBsmb.conf\fR(5) file.  However, a command
line setting will take precedence over settings in
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5).
.TP
\fB-i <scope>\fR
This specifies a NetBIOS scope that
\fBnmblookup\fR will use to communicate with when
generating NetBIOS names. For details on the use of NetBIOS
scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes are
\fBvery\fR rarely used, only set this parameter
if you are the system administrator in charge of all the
NetBIOS systems you communicate with.
.TP
\fB-W|--workgroup=domain\fR
Set the SMB domain of the username.   This
overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in
smb.conf.  If the domain specified is the same as the servers 
NetBIOS name, it causes the client to log on using the servers local 
SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM). 
.TP
\fB-O socket options\fR
TCP socket options to set on the client
socket. See the socket options parameter in
the \fBsmb.conf\fR(5) manual page for the list of valid
options. 
.TP
\fB-h|--help\fR
Print a summary of command line options.
.TP
\fB-B <broadcast address>\fR
Send the query to the given broadcast address. Without 
this option the default behavior of nmblookup is to send the 
query to the broadcast address of the network interfaces as 
either auto-detected or defined in the \fIinterfaces\fR
 parameter of the \fBsmb.conf\fR(5) file.
.TP
\fB-U <unicast address>\fR
Do a unicast query to the specified address or 
host \fIunicast address\fR. This option 
(along with the \fI-R\fR option) is needed to 
query a WINS server.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Prints the version number for 
\fBsmbd\fR.
.TP
\fB-s <configuration file>\fR
The file specified contains the 
configuration details required by the server.  The 
information in this file includes server-specific
information such as what printcap file to use, as well 
as descriptions of all the services that the server is 
to provide. See \fIsmb.conf(5)\fR for more information.
The default configuration file name is determined at 
compile time.
.TP
\fB-d|--debug=debuglevel\fR
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer 
from 0 to 10.  The default value if this parameter is 
not specified is zero.

The higher this value, the more detail will be 
logged to the log files about the activities of the 
server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious 
warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for
day to day running - it generates a small amount of 
information about operations carried out.

Levels above 1 will generate considerable 
amounts of log data, and should only be used when 
investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for 
use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

Note that specifying this parameter here will 
override the log
level file.
.TP
\fB-l|--logfile=logbasename\fR
File name for log/debug files. The extension
".client" will be appended. The log file is
never removed by the client.
.TP
\fB-T\fR
This causes any IP addresses found in the 
lookup to be looked up via a reverse DNS lookup into a 
DNS name, and printed out before each

\fBIP address .... NetBIOS name\fR

pair that is the normal output.
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Show which flags apply to the name that has been looked up. Possible 
answers are zero or more of: Response, Authoritative, 
Truncated, Recursion_Desired, Recursion_Available, Broadcast.
.TP
\fBname\fR
This is the NetBIOS name being queried. Depending 
upon the previous options this may be a NetBIOS name or IP address. 
If a NetBIOS name then the different name types may be specified 
by appending '#<type>' to the name. This name may also be
\&'*', which will return all registered names within a broadcast 
area.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
\fBnmblookup\fR can be used to query 
a WINS server (in the same way \fBnslookup\fR is 
used to query DNS servers). To query a WINS server, \fBnmblookup\fR 
must be called like this:
.PP
\fBnmblookup -U server -R 'name'\fR
.PP
For example, running :
.PP
\fBnmblookup -U samba.org -R 'IRIX#1B'\fR
.PP
would query the WINS server samba.org for the domain 
master browser (1B name type) for the IRIX workgroup.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3.0 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBnmbd\fR(8), \fBsamba\fR(7), and \fBsmb.conf\fR(5).
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at  ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison.  The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook
XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
