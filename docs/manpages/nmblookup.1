.SH NAME
nmblookup \- NetBIOS over TCP/IP client used to lookup NetBIOS  names
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnmblookup\fR [ \fB-M\fR ]  [ \fB-R\fR ]  [ \fB-S\fR ]  [ \fB-r\fR ]  [ \fB-A\fR ]  [ \fB-h\fR ]  [ \fB-B <broadcast address>\fR ]  [ \fB-U <unicast address>\fR ]  [ \fB-d <debug level>\fR ]  [ \fB-s <smb config file>\fR ]  [ \fB-i <NetBIOS scope>\fR ]  [ \fB-T\fR ]  \fBname\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
\fBnmblookup\fR is used to query NetBIOS names 
and map them to IP addresses in a network using NetBIOS over TCP/IP 
queries. The options allow the name queries to be directed at a 
particular IP broadcast area or to a particular machine. All queries 
are done over UDP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-M\fR
Searches for a master browser by looking 
up the NetBIOS name \fIname\fR with a 
type of 0x1d. If \fI name\fR is "-" then it does a lookup on the special name 
__MSBROWSE__.
.TP
\fB-R\fR
Set the recursion desired bit in the packet 
to do a recursive lookup. This is used when sending a name 
query to a machine running a WINS server and the user wishes 
to query the names in the WINS server. If this bit is unset 
the normal (broadcast responding) NetBIOS processing code 
on a machine is used instead. See rfc1001, rfc1002 for details.
.TP
\fB-S\fR
Once the name query has returned an IP 
address then do a node status query as well. A node status 
query returns the NetBIOS names registered by a host.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Try and bind to UDP port 137 to send and receive UDP
datagrams. The reason for this option is a bug in Windows 95 
where it ignores the source port of the requesting packet 
and only replies to UDP port 137. Unfortunately, on most UNIX 
systems root privilege is needed to bind to this port, and 
in addition, if the nmbd(8)
daemon is running on this machine it also binds to this port.
.TP
\fB-A\fR
Interpret \fIname\fR as 
an IP Address and do a node status query on this address.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print a help (usage) message.
.TP
\fB-B <broadcast address>\fR
Send the query to the given broadcast address. Without 
this option the default behavior of nmblookup is to send the 
query to the broadcast address of the network interfaces as 
either auto-detected or defined in the \fIinterfaces\fR
parameter of the \fIsmb.conf (5)\fR file.
.TP
\fB-U <unicast address>\fR
Do a unicast query to the specified address or 
host \fIunicast address\fR. This option 
(along with the \fI-R\fR option) is needed to 
query a WINS server.
.TP
\fB-d <debuglevel>\fR
debuglevel is an integer from 0 to 10.

The default value if this parameter is not specified 
is zero.

The higher this value, the more detail will be logged 
about the activities of \fBnmblookup\fR. At level 
0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged.

Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of 
log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem. 
Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and 
generate HUGE amounts of data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

Note that specifying this parameter here will override 
the \fI log level\fRparameter in the \fI smb.conf(5)\fR file.
.TP
\fB-s <smb.conf>\fR
This parameter specifies the pathname to 
the Samba configuration file,  smb.conf(5). This file controls all aspects of
the Samba setup on the machine.
.TP
\fB-i <scope>\fR
This specifies a NetBIOS scope that
\fBnmblookup\fR will use to communicate with when 
generating NetBIOS names. For details on the use of NetBIOS 
scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes are 
\fBvery\fR rarely used, only set this parameter 
if you are the system administrator in charge of all the 
NetBIOS systems you communicate with.
.TP
\fB-T\fR
This causes any IP addresses found in the 
lookup to be looked up via a reverse DNS lookup into a 
DNS name, and printed out before each

\fBIP address .... NetBIOS name\fR

pair that is the normal output.
.TP
\fBname\fR
This is the NetBIOS name being queried. Depending 
upon the previous options this may be a NetBIOS name or IP address. 
If a NetBIOS name then the different name types may be specified 
by appending '#<type>' to the name. This name may also be
\&'*', which will return all registered names within a broadcast 
area.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
\fBnmblookup\fR can be used to query 
a WINS server (in the same way \fBnslookup\fR is 
used to query DNS servers). To query a WINS server, 
\fBnmblookup\fR must be called like this:
.PP
\fBnmblookup -U server -R 'name'\fR
.PP
For example, running :
.PP
\fBnmblookup -U samba.org -R 'IRIX#1B'\fR
.PP
would query the WINS server samba.org for the domain 
master browser (1B name type) for the IRIX workgroup.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBnmbd(8)\fR, 
samba(7)
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
