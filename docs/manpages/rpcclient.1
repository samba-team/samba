.SH NAME
rpcclient \- tool for executing client side  MS-RPC functions
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrpcclient\fR \fBserver\fR [ \fB-A authfile\fR]  [ \fB-c <command string>\fR]  [ \fB-d debuglevel\fR]  [ \fB-h\fR]  [ \fB-l logfile\fR]  [ \fB-N\fR]  [ \fB-s <smb config file>\fR]  [ \fB-U username[%password]\fR]  [ \fB-W workgroup\fR]  [ \fB-N\fR] 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
\fBrpcclient\fR is a utility initially developed
to test MS-RPC functionality in Samba itself.  It has undergone 
several stages of development and stability.  Many system administrators
have now written scripts around it to manage Windows NT clients from 
their UNIX workstation. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBserver\fR
NetBIOS name of Server to which to connect. 
The server can be  any SMB/CIFS server.  The name is 
resolved using the   \fIname resolve order\fRline from 
\fIsmb.conf(5)\fR.
.TP
\fB-A|--authfile=filename\fR
This option allows 
you to specify a file from which to read the username and 
password used in the connection.  The format of the file is 


.nf
		username = <value> 
		password = <value>
		domain   = <value>
		
.fi

Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict 
access from unwanted users. 
.TP
\fB-c|--command='command string'\fR
execute semicolon separated commands (listed 
below)) 
.TP
\fB-d|--debug=debuglevel\fR
set the debuglevel. Debug level 0 is the lowest 
and 100 being the highest. This should be set to 100 if you are
planning on submitting a bug report to the Samba team (see \fIBUGS.txt\fR). 
.TP
\fB-h|--help\fR
Print a summary of command line options.
.TP
\fB-l|--logfile=logbasename\fR
File name for log/debug files. The extension 
\&'.client' will be appended. The log file is never removed  
by the client.
.TP
\fB-N|--nopass\fR
instruct \fBrpcclient\fR not to ask 
for a password.   By default, \fBrpcclient\fR will prompt 
for a password.  See also the \fI-U\fR option.
.TP
\fB-s|--conf=smb.conf\fR
Specifies the location of the all important 
\fIsmb.conf\fR file. 
.TP
\fB-U|--user=username[%password]\fR
Sets the SMB username or username and password. 

If %password is not specified, the user will be prompted. The 
client will first check the \fBUSER\fR environment variable, then the 
\fBLOGNAME\fR variable and if either exists, the 
string is uppercased. If these environmental variables are not 
found, the username GUEST is used. 

A third option is to use a credentials file which 
contains the plaintext of the username and password.  This 
option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin doesn't 
desire to pass the credentials on the command line or via environment 
variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions 
on the file restrict access from unwanted users.  See the 
\fI-A\fR for more details. 

Be cautious about including passwords in scripts. Also, on 
many systems the command line of a running process may be seen 
via the \fBps\fR command.  To be safe always allow 
\fBrpcclient\fR to prompt for a password and type 
it in directly. 
.TP
\fB-W|--workgroup=domain\fR
Set the SMB domain of the username.   This 
overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in 
smb.conf.  If the domain specified is the same as the server's NetBIOS name, 
it causes the client to log on using the  server's local SAM (as 
opposed to the Domain SAM).

\fBadddriver <arch> <config>\fR 
- Execute an AddPrinterDriver() RPC to install the printer driver 
information on the server.  Note that the driver files should 
already exist in the directory returned by  
\fBgetdriverdir\fR.  Possible values for 
\fIarch\fR are the same as those for 
the \fBgetdriverdir\fR command.
The \fIconfig\fR parameter is defined as 
follows: 


.nf
		Long Printer Name:\\
		Driver File Name:\\
		Data File Name:\\
		Config File Name:\\
		Help File Name:\\
		Language Monitor Name:\\
		Default Data Type:\\
		Comma Separated list of Files
		
.fi

Any empty fields should be enter as the string "NULL". 

Samba does not need to support the concept of Print Monitors
since these only apply to local printers whose driver can make
use of a bi-directional link for communication.  This field should 
be "NULL".   On a remote NT print server, the Print Monitor for a 
driver must already be installed prior to adding the driver or 
else the RPC will fail. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBaddprinter <printername> 
<sharename> <drivername> <port>\fR 
- Add a printer on the remote server.  This printer 
will be automatically shared.  Be aware that the printer driver 
must already be installed on the server (see \fBadddriver\fR) 
and the \fIport\fRmust be a valid port name (see
\fBenumports\fR.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBdeldriver\fR - Delete the 
specified printer driver for all architectures.  This
does not delete the actual driver files from the server,
only the entry from the server's list of drivers.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBenumdata\fR - Enumerate all 
printer setting data stored on the server. On Windows NT  clients, 
these values are stored  in the registry, while Samba servers 
store them in the printers TDB.  This command corresponds
to the MS Platform SDK GetPrinterData() function (* This
command is currently unimplemented).
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBenumjobs <printer>\fR 
- List the jobs and status of a given printer.  
This command corresponds to the MS Platform SDK EnumJobs() 
function (* This command is currently unimplemented).
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBenumports [level]\fR 
- Executes an EnumPorts() call using the specified 
info level. Currently only info levels 1 and 2 are supported. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBenumdrivers [level]\fR 
- Execute an EnumPrinterDrivers() call.  This lists the various installed 
printer drivers for all architectures.  Refer to the MS Platform SDK 
documentation for more details of the various flags and calling 
options. Currently supported info levels are 1, 2, and 3.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBenumprinters [level]\fR 
- Execute an EnumPrinters() call.  This lists the various installed 
and share printers.  Refer to the MS Platform SDK documentation for 
more details of the various flags and calling options. Currently
supported info levels are 0, 1, and 2.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBgetdata <printername>\fR 
- Retrieve the data for a given printer setting.  See 
the  \fBenumdata\fR command for more information.  
This command corresponds to the GetPrinterData() MS Platform 
SDK function (* This command is currently unimplemented). 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBgetdriver <printername>\fR 
- Retrieve the printer driver information (such as driver file, 
config file, dependent files, etc...) for 
the given printer. This command corresponds to the GetPrinterDriver()
MS Platform  SDK function. Currently info level 1, 2, and 3 are supported.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBgetdriverdir <arch>\fR 
- Execute a GetPrinterDriverDirectory()
RPC to retreive the SMB share name and subdirectory for 
storing printer driver files for a given architecture.  Possible 
values for \fIarch\fR are "Windows 4.0" 
(for Windows 95/98), "Windows NT x86", "Windows NT PowerPC", "Windows
Alpha_AXP", and "Windows NT R4000". 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBgetprinter <printername>\fR

\fR.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBrpcclient\fR is designed as a developer testing tool 
and may not be robust in certain areas (such as command line parsing).  
It has been known to  generate a core dump upon failures when invalid 
parameters where passed to the interpreter. 
.PP
From Luke Leighton's original rpcclient man page:
.PP
\fB"WARNING!\fR The MSRPC over SMB code has 
been developed from examining  Network traces. No documentation is 
available from the original creators  (Microsoft) on how MSRPC over 
SMB works, or how the individual MSRPC services  work. Microsoft's 
implementation of these services has been demonstrated  (and reported) 
to be... a bit flaky in places. 
.PP
The development of Samba's implementation is also a bit rough, 
and as more  of the services are understood, it can even result in 
versions of  \fBsmbd(8)\fR and \fBrpcclient(1)\fR 
that are incompatible for some commands or  services. Additionally, 
the developers are sending reports to Microsoft,  and problems found 
or reported to Microsoft are fixed in Service Packs,  which may 
result in incompatibilities." 
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3.0 of the Samba 
suite.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original rpcclient man page was written by Matthew 
Geddes, Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton, and rewritten by Gerald Carter.  
The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald 
Carter.
