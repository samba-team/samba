.PP
The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that implements the Server Message Block (commonly abbreviated as SMB) protocol for UNIX systems\&. This protocol is sometimes also referred to as the Common Internet File System (CIFS)\&. For a more thorough description, see http://www\&.ubiqx\&.org/cifs/\&. Samba also implements the NetBIOS protocol in nmbd\&.

.SH "COMPONENTS"

.PP
The Samba suite is made up of several components\&. Each component is described in a separate manual page\&. It is strongly recommended that you read the documentation that comes with Samba and the manual pages of those components that you use\&. If the manual pages and documents aren't clear enough then please visithttp://devel\&.samba\&.org for information on how to file a bug report or submit a patch\&.

.PP
If you require help, visit the Samba webpage athttp://www\&.samba\&.org/ and explore the many option available to you\&.

.SH "AVAILABILITY"

.PP
The Samba software suite is licensed under the GNU Public License(GPL)\&. A copy of that license should have come with the package in the file COPYING\&. You are encouraged to distribute copies of the Samba suite, but please obey the terms of this license\&.

.PP
The latest version of the Samba suite can be obtained via anonymous ftp from samba\&.org in the directory pub/samba/\&. It is also available on several mirror sites worldwide\&.

.PP
You may also find useful information about Samba on the newsgroup comp\&.protocol\&.smb and the Samba mailing list\&. Details on how to join the mailing list are given in the README file that comes with Samba\&.

.PP
If you have access to a WWW viewer (such as Mozilla or Konqueror) then you will also find lots of useful information, including back issues of the Samba mailing list, athttp://lists\&.samba\&.org\&.

.SH "VERSION"

.PP
This man page is correct for version 3\&.0 of the Samba suite\&.

.SH "CONTRIBUTIONS"

.PP
If you wish to contribute to the Samba project, then I suggest you join the Samba mailing list athttp://lists\&.samba\&.org\&.

.PP
If you have patches to submit, visithttp://devel\&.samba\&.org/ for information on how to do it properly\&. We prefer patches in \fBdiff -u\fR format\&.

.SH "CONTRIBUTORS"

.PP
Contributors to the project are now too numerous to mention here but all deserve the thanks of all Samba users\&. To see a full list, look at the\fIchange-log\fR in the source package for the pre-CVS changes and at http://cvs\&.samba\&.org/ for the contributors to Samba post-CVS\&. CVS is the Open Source source code control system used by the Samba Team to develop Samba\&. The project would have been unmanageable without it\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.

.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
