.SH NAME
smb.conf \- The configuration file for the Samba suite
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
The \fIsmb.conf\fR file is a configuration 
file for the Samba suite. \fIsmb.conf\fR contains 
runtime configuration information for the Samba programs. The
\fIsmb.conf\fR file is designed to be configured and 
administered by the \fBswat(8)\fR
program. The complete description of the file format and 
possible parameters held within are here for reference purposes.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of sections and parameters. A section 
begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues 
until the next section begins. Sections contain parameters of the 
form
.PP
\fIname\fR = \fIvalue
\fR.PP
The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated 
line represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter.
.PP
Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.
.PP
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant. 
Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded.
Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter 
names is irrelevant. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter 
value is discarded. Internal whitespace within a parameter value 
is retained verbatim.
.PP
Any line beginning with a semicolon (';') or a hash ('#') 
character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.
.PP
Any line ending in a '\\' is continued
on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion.
.PP
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all 
either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given 
as yes/no, 0/1 or true/false. Case is not significant in boolean 
values, but is preserved in string values. Some items such as 
create modes are numeric.
.SH "SECTION DESCRIPTIONS"
.PP
Each section in the configuration file (except for the
[global] section) describes a shared resource (known
as a "share"). The section name is the name of the 
shared resource and the parameters within the section define 
the shares attributes.
.PP
There are three special sections, [global],
[homes] and [printers], which are
described under \fBspecial sections\fR. The
following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions.
.PP
A share consists of a directory to which access is being 
given plus a description of the access rights which are granted 
to the user of the service. Some housekeeping options are 
also specifiable.
.PP
Sections are either file share services (used by the 
client as an extension of their native file systems) or 
printable services (used by the client to access print services 
on the host running the server).
.PP
Sections may be designated \fBguest\fR services,
in which case no password is required to access them. A specified 
UNIX \fBguest account\fR is used to define access
privileges in this case.
.PP
Sections other than guest services will require a password 
to access them. The client provides the username. As older clients 
only provide passwords and not usernames, you may specify a list 
of usernames to check against the password using the "user =" 
option in the share definition. For modern clients such as 
Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000, this should not be necessary.
.PP
Note that the access rights granted by the server are 
masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest 
UNIX user by the host system. The server does not grant more
access than the host system grants.
.PP
The following sample section defines a file space share. 
The user has write access to the path \fI/home/bar\fR. 
The share is accessed via the share name "foo":
.sp
.nf
	 	[foo]
 		path = /home/bar
 		writeable = true
	
	
.sp
.fi
.PP
The following sample section defines a printable share. 
The share is readonly, but printable. That is, the only write 
access permitted is via calls to open, write to and close a 
spool file. The \fBguest ok\fR parameter means 
access will be permitted as the default guest user (specified 
elsewhere):
.sp
.nf
	 	[aprinter]
 		path = /usr/spool/public
 		writeable = false
 		printable = true
 		guest ok = true
	
	
.sp
.fi
.SH "SPECIAL SECTIONS"
.SS "THE  GLOBAL  SECTION"
.PP
parameters in this section apply to the server 
as a whole, or are defaults for sections which do not 
specifically define certain items. See the notes
under PARAMETERS for more information.
.SS "THE  HOMES  SECTION"
.PP
If a section called homes is included in the 
configuration file, services connecting clients to their 
home directories can be created on the fly by the server.
.PP
When the connection request is made, the existing 
sections are scanned. If a match is found, it is used. If no 
match is found, the requested section name is treated as a 
user name and looked up in the local password file. If the 
name exists and the correct password has been given, a share is 
created by cloning the [homes] section.
.PP
Some modifications are then made to the newly 
created share:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The share name is changed from homes to 
the located username.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If no path was given, the path is set to
the user's home directory.
.PP
If you decide to use a \fBpath =\fR line 
in your [homes] section then you may find it useful 
to use the %S macro. For example :
.PP
.PP
\fBpath = /data/pchome/%S\fR
.PP
.PP
would be useful if you have different home directories 
for your PCs than for UNIX access.
.PP
.PP
This is a fast and simple way to give a large number 
of clients access to their home directories with a minimum 
of fuss.
.PP
.PP
A similar process occurs if the requested section 
name is "homes", except that the share name is not 
changed to that of the requesting user. This method of using
the [homes] section works well if different users share 
a client PC.
.PP
.PP
The [homes] section can specify all the parameters 
a normal service section can specify, though some make more sense 
than others. The following is a typical and suitable [homes]
section:
.PP
.sp
.nf
			 	[homes]
 			writeable = yes
		
		
.sp
.fi
.PP
An important point is that if guest access is specified 
in the [homes] section, all home directories will be 
visible to all clients \fBwithout a password\fR. 
In the very unlikely event that this is actually desirable, it 
would be wise to also specify \fBread only
access\fR.
.PP
.PP
Note that the \fBbrowseable\fR flag for 
auto home directories will be inherited from the global browseable 
flag, not the [homes] browseable flag. This is useful as 
it means setting \fBbrowseable = no\fR in
the [homes] section will hide the [homes] share but make
any auto home directories visible.
.PP
.SS "THE  PRINTERS  SECTION"
.PP
This section works like [homes], 
but for printers.
.PP
If a [printers] section occurs in the 
configuration file, users are able to connect to any printer 
specified in the local host's printcap file.
.PP
When a connection request is made, the existing sections 
are scanned. If a match is found, it is used. If no match is found, 
but a [homes] section exists, it is used as described
above. Otherwise, the requested section name is treated as a
printer name and the appropriate printcap file is scanned to see 
if the requested section name is a valid printer share name. If 
a match is found, a new printer share is created by cloning 
the [printers] section.
.PP
A few modifications are then made to the newly created 
share:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The share name is set to the located printer 
name
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If no printer name was given, the printer name 
is set to the located printer name
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If the share does not permit guest access and 
no username was given, the username is set to the located 
printer name.
.PP
Note that the [printers] service MUST be 
printable - if you specify otherwise, the server will refuse 
to load the configuration file.
.PP
.PP
Typically the path specified would be that of a 
world-writeable spool directory with the sticky bit set on 
it. A typical [printers] entry would look like 
this:
.PP
.sp
.nf
	 	[printers]
 			path = /usr/spool/public
 			guest ok = yes
 			printable = yes 
		
.sp
.fi
.PP
All aliases given for a printer in the printcap file 
are legitimate printer names as far as the server is concerned. 
If your printing subsystem doesn't work like that, you will have 
to set up a pseudo-printcap. This is a file consisting of one or 
more lines like this:
.PP
.sp
.nf
			        alias|alias|alias|alias...    
		
		
.sp
.fi
.PP
Each alias should be an acceptable printer name for 
your printing subsystem. In the [global] section, specify 
the new file as your printcap. The server will then only recognize 
names found in your pseudo-printcap, which of course can contain 
whatever aliases you like. The same technique could be used 
simply to limit access to a subset of your local printers.
.PP
.PP
An alias, by the way, is defined as any component of the 
first entry of a printcap record. Records are separated by newlines,
components (if there are more than one) are separated by vertical 
bar symbols ('|').
.PP
.PP
NOTE: On SYSV systems which use lpstat to determine what 
printers are defined on the system you may be able to use
"printcap name = lpstat" to automatically obtain a list 
of printers. See the "printcap name" option 
for more details.
.PP
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
parameters define the specific attributes of sections.
.PP
Some parameters are specific to the [global] section
(e.g., \fBsecurity\fR). Some parameters are usable 
in all sections (e.g., \fBcreate mode\fR). All others 
are permissible only in normal sections. For the purposes of the 
following descriptions the [homes] and [printers]
sections will be considered normal. The letter \fBG\fR 
in parentheses indicates that a parameter is specific to the
[global] section. The letter \fBS\fR
indicates that a parameter can be specified in a service specific
section. Note that all \fBS\fR parameters can also be specified in 
the [global] section - in which case they will define
the default behavior for all services.
.PP
parameters are arranged here in alphabetical order - this may 
not create best bedfellows, but at least you can find them! Where
there are synonyms, the preferred synonym is described, others refer 
to the preferred synonym.
.SH "VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS"
.PP
Many of the strings that are settable in the config file 
can take substitutions. For example the option "path =
/tmp/%u" would be interpreted as "path = 
/tmp/john" if the user connected with the username john.
.PP
These substitutions are mostly noted in the descriptions below, 
but there are some general substitutions which apply whenever they 
might be relevant. These are:
.TP
\fB%S\fR
the name of the current service, if any.
.TP
\fB%P\fR
the root directory of the current service, 
if any.
.TP
\fB%u\fR
user name of the current service, if any.
.TP
\fB%g\fR
primary group name of %u.
.TP
\fB%U\fR
session user name (the user name that the client 
wanted, not necessarily the same as the one they got).
.TP
\fB%G\fR
primary group name of %U.
.TP
\fB%H\fR
the home directory of the user given 
by %u.
.TP
\fB%v\fR
the Samba version.
.TP
\fB%h\fR
the Internet hostname that Samba is running 
on.
.TP
\fB%m\fR
the NetBIOS name of the client machine 
(very useful).
.TP
\fB%L\fR
the NetBIOS name of the server. This allows you 
to change your config based on what the client calls you. Your 
server can have a "dual personality".
.TP
\fB%M\fR
the Internet name of the client machine.
.TP
\fB%N\fR
the name of your NIS home directory server. 
This is obtained from your NIS auto.map entry. If you have 
not compiled Samba with the \fB--with-automount\fR 
option then this value will be the same as %L.
.TP
\fB%p\fR
the path of the service's home directory, 
obtained from your NIS auto.map entry. The NIS auto.map entry 
is split up as "%N:%p".
.TP
\fB%R\fR
the selected protocol level after 
protocol negotiation. It can be one of CORE, COREPLUS, 
LANMAN1, LANMAN2 or NT1.
.TP
\fB%d\fR
The process id of the current server
process.
.TP
\fB%a\fR
the architecture of the remote
machine. Only some are recognized, and those may not be 
100% reliable. It currently recognizes Samba, WfWg, Win95,
WinNT and Win2k. Anything else will be known as 
"UNKNOWN". If it gets it wrong then sending a level 
3 log to samba@samba.org
 <URL:mailto:samba@samba.org> should allow it to be fixed.
.TP
\fB%I\fR
The IP address of the client machine.
.TP
\fB%T\fR
the current date and time.
.TP
\fB%$(\fIenvvar\fB)\fR
The value of the environment variable
\fIenvar\fR.
.PP
There are some quite creative things that can be done 
with these substitutions and other smb.conf options.
.PP
.SH "NAME MANGLING"
.PP
Samba supports "name mangling" so that DOS and 
Windows clients can use files that don't conform to the 8.3 format. 
It can also be set to adjust the case of 8.3 format filenames.
.PP
There are several options that control the way mangling is 
performed, and they are grouped here rather than listed separately. 
For the defaults look at the output of the testparm program. 
.PP
All of these options can be set separately for each service 
(or globally, of course). 
.PP
The options are: 
.TP
\fBmangle case = yes/no\fR
controls if names that have characters that 
aren't of the "default" case are mangled. For example, 
if this is yes then a name like "Mail" would be mangled. 
Default \fBno\fR.
.TP
\fBcase sensitive = yes/no\fR
controls whether filenames are case sensitive. If 
they aren't then Samba must do a filename search and match on passed 
names. Default \fBno\fR.
.TP
\fBdefault case = upper/lower\fR
controls what the default case is for new 
filenames. Default \fBlower\fR.
.TP
\fBpreserve case = yes/no\fR
controls if new files are created with the 
case that the client passes, or if they are forced to be the 
"default" case. Default \fByes\fR.
.TP
\fBshort preserve case = yes/no\fR
controls if new files which conform to 8.3 syntax,
that is all in upper case and of suitable length, are created 
upper case, or if they are forced to be the "default" 
case. This option can be use with "preserve case = yes" 
to permit long filenames to retain their case, while short names 
are lowercased. Default \fByes\fR.
.PP
By default, Samba 2.2 has the same semantics as a Windows 
NT server, in that it is case insensitive but case preserving.
.PP
.SH "NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION"
.PP
There are a number of ways in which a user can connect 
to a service. The server uses the following steps in determining 
if it will allow a connection to a specified service. If all the 
steps fail, then the connection request is rejected. However, if one of the 
steps succeeds, then the following steps are not checked.
.PP
If the service is marked "guest only = yes" and the
server is running with share-level security ("security = share")
then steps 1 to 5 are skipped.
.IP 1. 
If the client has passed a username/password 
pair and that username/password pair is validated by the UNIX 
system's password programs then the connection is made as that 
username. Note that this includes the 
\\\\server\\service%\fIusername\fR method of passing 
a username.
.IP 2. 
If the client has previously registered a username 
with the system and now supplies a correct password for that 
username then the connection is allowed.
.IP 3. 
The client's NetBIOS name and any previously 
used user names are checked against the supplied password, if 
they match then the connection is allowed as the corresponding 
user.
.IP 4. 
If the client has previously validated a
username/password pair with the server and the client has passed 
the validation token then that username is used. 
.IP 5. 
If a "user = " field is given in the
\fIsmb.conf\fR file for the service and the client 
has supplied a password, and that password matches (according to 
the UNIX system's password checking) with one of the usernames 
from the "user =" field then the connection is made as 
the username in the "user =" line. If one 
of the username in the "user =" list begins with a
\&'@' then that name expands to a list of names in 
the group of the same name.
.IP 6. 
If the service is a guest service then a 
connection is made as the username given in the "guest 
account =" for the service, irrespective of the 
supplied password.
.SH "COMPLETE LIST OF GLOBAL PARAMETERS"

\fBThis parameter only exists in the HEAD cvs branch\fR
This a full path name to a script called by
\fBsmbd(8)\fRthat

This command will be run as user.

Default: \fBNone\fR.

Example: \fBabort shutdown script = /sbin/shutdown -c\fR
.TP
\fBadd printer command (G)\fR
With the introduction of MS-RPC based printing
support for Windows NT/2000 clients in Samba 2.2, The MS Add
Printer Wizard (APW) icon is now also available in the 
"Printers..." folder displayed a share listing. The APW
allows for printers to be add remotely to a Samba or Windows 
NT/2000 print server.

For a Samba host this means that the printer must be 
physically added to the underlying printing system. The \fIadd 
printer command\fR defines a script to be run which 
will perform the necessary operations for adding the printer
to the print system and to add the appropriate service definition 
to the \fIsmb.conf\fR file in order that it can be 
shared by \fBsmbd(8)\fR
.

The \fIadd printer command\fR is
automatically invoked with the following parameter (in 
order:

\fBadd share command (G)\fR
Samba 2.2.0 introduced the ability to dynamically 
add and delete shares via the Windows NT 4.0 Server Manager. The 
\fIadd share command\fR is used to define an 
external program or script which will add a new service definition 
to \fIsmb.conf\fR. In order to successfully 
execute the \fIadd share command\fR, \fBsmbd\fR
requires that the administrator be connected using a root account (i.e. 
uid == 0).

When executed, \fBsmbd\fR will automatically invoke the 
\fIadd share command\fR with four parameters.

\fBadd machine script (G)\fR
This is the full pathname to a script that will 
be run by smbd(8)when a machine is added
to it's domain using the administrator username and password method. 

This option is only required when using sam back-ends tied to the
Unix uid method of RID calculation such as smbpasswd. This option is only
available in Samba 3.0.

Default: \fBadd machine script = <empty string>
\fR
Example: \fBadd machine script = /usr/sbin/adduser -n -g machines -c Machine -d /dev/null -s /bin/false %u
\fR.TP
\fBadd user script (G)\fR
This is the full pathname to a script that will 
be run \fBAS ROOT\fR by smbd(8)
under special circumstances described below.

Normally, a Samba server requires that UNIX users are 
created for all users accessing files on this server. For sites 
that use Windows NT account databases as their primary user database 
creating these users and keeping the user list in sync with the 
Windows NT PDC is an onerous task. This option allows smbdto create the required UNIX users 
\fBON DEMAND\fR when a user accesses the Samba server.

In order to use this option, smbd
must \fBNOT\fR be set to \fIsecurity = share\fR
and \fIadd user script\fR
must be set to a full pathname for a script that will create a UNIX 
user given one argument of \fI%u\fR, which expands into 
the UNIX user name to create.

When the Windows user attempts to access the Samba server, 
at login (session setup in the SMB protocol) time,  smbdcontacts the \fIpassword server\fR and 
attempts to authenticate the given user with the given password. If the 
authentication succeeds then \fBsmbd\fR 
attempts to find a UNIX user in the UNIX password database to map the 
Windows user into. If this lookup fails, and \fIadd user script
\fRis set then \fBsmbd\fR will
call the specified script \fBAS ROOT\fR, expanding 
any \fI%u\fR argument to be the user name to create.

If this script successfully creates the user then \fBsmbd
\fRwill continue on as though the UNIX user
already existed. In this way, UNIX users are dynamically created to
match existing Windows NT accounts.

See also \fI security\fR,  \fIpassword server\fR, 
\fIdelete user 
script\fR.

Default: \fBadd user script = <empty string>
\fR
Example: \fBadd user script = /usr/local/samba/bin/add_user 
%u\fR
.TP
\fBadmin users (S)\fR
This is a list of users who will be granted 
administrative privileges on the share. This means that they 
will do all file operations as the super-user (root).

You should use this option very carefully, as any user in 
this list will be able to do anything they like on the share, 
irrespective of file permissions.

Default: \fBno admin users\fR

Example: \fBadmin users = jason\fR
.TP
\fBallow hosts (S)\fR
Synonym for  \fIhosts allow\fR.
.TP
\fBallow trusted domains (G)\fR
This option only takes effect when the \fIsecurity\fR option is set to 
server or domain. 
If it is set to no, then attempts to connect to a resource from 
a domain or workgroup other than the one which smbdis running 
in will fail, even if that domain is trusted by the remote server 
doing the authentication.

This is useful if you only want your Samba server to 
serve resources to users in the domain it is a member of. As 
an example, suppose that there are two domains DOMA and DOMB. DOMB 
is trusted by DOMA, which contains the Samba server. Under normal 
circumstances, a user with an account in DOMB can then access the 
resources of a UNIX account with the same account name on the 
Samba server even if they do not have an account in DOMA. This 
can make implementing a security boundary difficult.

Default: \fBallow trusted domains = yes\fR
.TP
\fBannounce as (G)\fR
This specifies what type of server 
\fBnmbd\fR
will announce itself as, to a network neighborhood browse 
list. By default this is set to Windows NT. The valid options 
are : "NT Server" (which can also be written as "NT"), 
"NT Workstation", "Win95" or "WfW" meaning Windows NT Server, 
Windows NT Workstation, Windows 95 and Windows for Workgroups 
respectively. Do not change this parameter unless you have a 
specific need to stop Samba appearing as an NT server as this 
may prevent Samba servers from participating as browser servers 
correctly.

Default: \fBannounce as = NT Server\fR

Example: \fBannounce as = Win95\fR
.TP
\fBannounce version (G)\fR
This specifies the major and minor version numbers 
that nmbd will use when announcing itself as a server. The default 
is 4.2. Do not change this parameter unless you have a specific 
need to set a Samba server to be a downlevel server.

Default: \fBannounce version = 4.5\fR

Example: \fBannounce version = 2.0\fR
.TP
\fBauto services (G)\fR
This is a synonym for the  \fIpreload\fR.
.TP
\fBavailable (S)\fR
This parameter lets you "turn off" a service. If 
\fIavailable = no\fR, then \fBALL\fR 
attempts to connect to the service will fail. Such failures are 
logged.

Default: \fBavailable = yes\fR
.TP
\fBbind interfaces only (G)\fR
This global parameter allows the Samba admin 
to limit what interfaces on a machine will serve SMB requests. If 
affects file service smbd(8)and 
name service nmbd(8)in slightly 
different ways.

For name service it causes \fBnmbd\fR to bind 
to ports 137 and 138 on the interfaces listed in the interfaces parameter. \fBnmbd
\fRalso binds to the "all addresses" interface (0.0.0.0) 
on ports 137 and 138 for the purposes of reading broadcast messages. 
If this option is not set then \fBnmbd\fR will service 
name requests on all of these sockets. If \fIbind interfaces
only\fR is set then \fBnmbd\fR will check the 
source address of any packets coming in on the broadcast sockets 
and discard any that don't match the broadcast addresses of the 
interfaces in the \fIinterfaces\fR parameter list. 
As unicast packets are received on the other sockets it allows 
\fBnmbd\fR to refuse to serve names to machines that 
send packets that arrive through any interfaces not listed in the
\fIinterfaces\fR list. IP Source address spoofing
does defeat this simple check, however so it must not be used
seriously as a security feature for \fBnmbd\fR.

For file service it causes smbd(8)
to bind only to the interface list given in the  interfaces parameter. This restricts the networks that 
\fBsmbd\fR will serve to packets coming in those 
interfaces. Note that you should not use this parameter for machines 
that are serving PPP or other intermittent or non-broadcast network 
interfaces as it will not cope with non-permanent interfaces.

If \fIbind interfaces only\fR is set then 
unless the network address \fB127.0.0.1\fR is added 
to the \fIinterfaces\fR parameter list \fBsmbpasswd(8)\fR
and \fBswat(8)\fRmay 
not work as expected due to the reasons covered below.

To change a users SMB password, the \fBsmbpasswd\fR
by default connects to the \fBlocalhost - 127.0.0.1\fR 
address as an SMB client to issue the password change request. If 
\fIbind interfaces only\fR is set then unless the 
network address \fB127.0.0.1\fR is added to the
\fIinterfaces\fR parameter list then \fB smbpasswd\fR will fail to connect in it's default mode. 
\fBsmbpasswd\fR can be forced to use the primary IP interface 
of the local host by using its  \fI-r remote machine\fR
parameter, with \fIremote machine\fR set 
to the IP name of the primary interface of the local host.

The \fBswat\fR status page tries to connect with
\fBsmbd\fR and \fBnmbd\fR at the address 
\fB127.0.0.1\fR to determine if they are running. 
Not adding \fB127.0.0.1\fR will cause \fB smbd\fR and \fBnmbd\fR to always show
"not running" even if they really are. This can prevent \fB swat\fR from starting/stopping/restarting \fBsmbd\fR
and \fBnmbd\fR.

Default: \fBbind interfaces only = no\fR
.TP
\fBblocking locks (S)\fR
This parameter controls the behavior of smbd(8)when given a request by a client 
to obtain a byte range lock on a region of an open file, and the 
request has a time limit associated with it.

If this parameter is set and the lock range requested 
cannot be immediately satisfied, Samba 2.2 will internally 
queue the lock request, and periodically attempt to obtain 
the lock until the timeout period expires.

If this parameter is set to false, then 
Samba 2.2 will behave as previous versions of Samba would and 
will fail the lock request immediately if the lock range 
cannot be obtained.

Default: \fBblocking locks = yes\fR
.TP
\fBbrowsable (S)\fR
See the \fI browseable\fR.
.TP
\fBbrowse list (G)\fR
This controls whether  \fBsmbd(8)\fRwill serve a browse list to 
a client doing a \fBNetServerEnum\fR call. Normally 
set to true. You should never need to change 
this.

Default: \fBbrowse list = yes\fR
.TP
\fBbrowseable (S)\fR
This controls whether this share is seen in 
the list of available shares in a net view and in the browse list.

Default: \fBbrowseable = yes\fR
.TP
\fBcase sensitive (S)\fR
See the discussion in the section NAME MANGLING.

Default: \fBcase sensitive = no\fR
.TP
\fBcasesignames (S)\fR
Synonym for case 
sensitive.
.TP
\fBchange notify timeout (G)\fR
This SMB allows a client to tell a server to 
"watch" a particular directory for any changes and only reply to
the SMB request when a change has occurred. Such constant scanning of
a directory is expensive under UNIX, hence an  \fBsmbd(8)\fRdaemon only performs such a scan 
on each requested directory once every \fIchange notify 
timeout\fR seconds.

Default: \fBchange notify timeout = 60\fR

Example: \fBchange notify timeout = 300\fR

Would change the scan time to every 5 minutes.
.TP
\fBchange share command (G)\fR
Samba 2.2.0 introduced the ability to dynamically 
add and delete shares via the Windows NT 4.0 Server Manager. The 
\fIchange share command\fR is used to define an 
external program or script which will modify an existing service definition 
in \fIsmb.conf\fR. In order to successfully 
execute the \fIchange share command\fR, \fBsmbd\fR
requires that the administrator be connected using a root account (i.e. 
uid == 0).

When executed, \fBsmbd\fR will automatically invoke the 
\fIchange share command\fR with four parameters.

\fBclient code page (G)\fR
This parameter specifies the DOS code page

\fBconfig file (G)\fR
This allows you to override the config file 
to use, instead of the default (usually \fIsmb.conf\fR). 
There is a chicken and egg problem here as this option is set 
in the config file!

For this reason, if the name of the config file has changed 
when the parameters are loaded then it will reload them from 
the new config file.

This option takes the usual substitutions, which can 
be very useful.

If the config file doesn't exist then it won't be loaded 
(allowing you to special case the config files of just a few 
clients).

Example: \fBconfig file = /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf.%m
\fR.TP
\fBcopy (S)\fR
This parameter allows you to "clone" service 
entries. The specified service is simply duplicated under the 
current service's name. Any parameters specified in the current 
section will override those in the section being copied.

This feature lets you set up a 'template' service and 
create similar services easily. Note that the service being 
copied must occur earlier in the configuration file than the 
service doing the copying.

Default: \fBno value\fR

Example: \fBcopy = otherservice\fR
.TP
\fBcreate mask (S)\fR
A synonym for this parameter is 
\fIcreate mode\fR
\&.

When a file is created, the necessary permissions are 
calculated according to the mapping from DOS modes to UNIX 
permissions, and the resulting UNIX mode is then bit-wise 'AND'ed 
with this parameter. This parameter may be thought of as a bit-wise 
MASK for the UNIX modes of a file. Any bit \fBnot\fR 
set here will be removed from the modes set on a file when it is 
created.

The default value of this parameter removes the 
\&'group' and 'other' write and execute bits from the UNIX modes.

Following this Samba will bit-wise 'OR' the UNIX mode created 
from this parameter with the value of the \fIforce create mode\fR
parameter which is set to 000 by default.

This parameter does not affect directory modes. See the 
parameter \fIdirectory mode
\fRfor details.

See also the \fIforce 
create mode\fR parameter for forcing particular mode 
bits to be set on created files. See also the  \fIdirectory mode\fR parameter for masking 
mode bits on created directories. See also the  \fIinherit permissions\fR parameter.

Note that this parameter does not apply to permissions
set by Windows NT/2000 ACL editors. If the administrator wishes to enforce
a mask on access control lists also, they need to set the \fIsecurity mask\fR.

Default: \fBcreate mask = 0744\fR

\fBcreate mode (S)\fR
This is a synonym for \fI create mask\fR.
.TP
\fBcsc policy (S)\fR
This stands for \fBclient-side caching 
policy\fR, and specifies how clients capable of offline
caching will cache the files in the share. The valid values
are: manual, documents, programs, disable.

These values correspond to those used on Windows
servers.

For example, shares containing roaming profiles can have
offline caching disabled using \fBcsc policy = disable
\fR\&.

Default: \fBcsc policy = manual\fR

Example: \fBcsc policy = programs\fR
.TP
\fBdeadtime (G)\fR
The value of the parameter (a decimal integer) 
represents the number of minutes of inactivity before a connection 
is considered dead, and it is disconnected. The deadtime only takes 
effect if the number of open files is zero.

This is useful to stop a server's resources being 
exhausted by a large number of inactive connections.

Most clients have an auto-reconnect feature when a 
connection is broken so in most cases this parameter should be 
transparent to users.

Using this parameter with a timeout of a few minutes 
is recommended for most systems.

A deadtime of zero indicates that no auto-disconnection 
should be performed.

Default: \fBdeadtime = 0\fR

Example: \fBdeadtime = 15\fR

\fBdebug hires timestamp (G)\fR
Sometimes the timestamps in the log messages 
are needed with a resolution of higher that seconds, this

\fBdebug pid (G)\fR
When using only one log file for more then one 
forked smbd-process there may be hard to follow which process 
outputs which message. This boolean parameter is adds the process-id

Note that the parameter \fI debug timestamp\fR must be on for this to have an 
effect.

Default: \fBdebug pid = no\fR
.TP
\fBdebug timestamp (G)\fR
Samba 2.2 debug log messages are timestamped

\fBdebug uid (G)\fR
Samba is sometimes run as root and sometime 
run as the connected user, this boolean parameter inserts the 
current euid, egid, uid and gid to the timestamp message headers

Note that the parameter \fI debug timestamp\fR must be on for this to have an 
effect.

Default: \fBdebug uid = no\fR

Default: \fBdefault case = lower\fR
.TP
\fBdefault devmode (S)\fR
This parameter is only applicable to printable services. When smbd is serving
Printer Drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients, each printer on the Samba
server has a Device Mode which defines things such as paper size and
orientation and duplex settings. The device mode can only correctly be
generated by the printer driver itself (which can only be executed on a
Win32 platform). Because smbd is unable to execute the driver code
to generate the device mode, the default behavior is to set this field
to NULL.

Most problems with serving printer drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients
can be traced to a problem with the generated device mode. Certain drivers
will do things such as crashing the client's Explorer.exe with a NULL devmode.
However, other printer drivers can cause the client's spooler service
(spoolsv.exe) to die if the devmode was not created by the driver itself
(i.e. smbd generates a default devmode).

This parameter should be used with care and tested with the printer
driver in question. It is better to leave the device mode to NULL
and let the Windows client set the correct values. Because drivers do not
do this all the time, setting \fBdefault devmode = yes\fR
will instruct smbd to generate a default one.

For more information on Windows NT/2k printing and Device Modes,
see the MSDN documentation <URL:http://msdn.microsoft.com/>.

Default: \fBdefault devmode = no\fR
.TP
\fBdefault service (G)\fR
This parameter specifies the name of a service
which will be connected to if the service actually requested cannot
be found. Note that the square brackets are \fBNOT\fR
given in the parameter value (see example below).

There is no default value for this parameter. If this 
parameter is not given, attempting to connect to a nonexistent 
service results in an error.

Typically the default service would be a  \fIguest ok\fR,  \fIread-only\fR service.

Also note that the apparent service name will be changed 
to equal that of the requested service, this is very useful as it 
allows you to use macros like \fI%S\fR to make 
a wildcard service.

Note also that any "_" characters in the name of the service 
used in the default service will get mapped to a "/". This allows for
interesting things.

Example:

.sp
.nf
[global]
	default service = pub
        
[pub]
	path = /%S
		
.sp
.fi

\fBdelete printer command (G)\fR
With the introduction of MS-RPC based printer
support for Windows NT/2000 clients in Samba 2.2, it is now 
possible to delete printer at run time by issuing the 
DeletePrinter() RPC call.

For a Samba host this means that the printer must be 
physically deleted from underlying printing system. The \fI deleteprinter command\fR defines a script to be run which 
will perform the necessary operations for removing the printer
from the print system and from \fIsmb.conf\fR.

The \fIdelete printer command\fR is 
automatically called with only one parameter: \fI "printer name"\fR.

Once the \fIdelete printer command\fR has 
been executed, \fBsmbd\fR will reparse the \fI smb.conf\fR to associated printer no longer exists. 
If the sharename is still valid, then \fBsmbd
\fRwill return an ACCESS_DENIED error to the client.

\fBdelete readonly (S)\fR
This parameter allows readonly files to be deleted. 
This is not normal DOS semantics, but is allowed by UNIX.

This option may be useful for running applications such 
as rcs, where UNIX file ownership prevents changing file 
permissions, and DOS semantics prevent deletion of a read only file.

Default: \fBdelete readonly = no\fR

\fBdelete share command (G)\fR
Samba 2.2.0 introduced the ability to dynamically 
add and delete shares via the Windows NT 4.0 Server Manager. The 
\fIdelete share command\fR is used to define an 
external program or script which will remove an existing service 
definition from \fIsmb.conf\fR. In order to successfully 
execute the \fIdelete share command\fR, \fBsmbd\fR
requires that the administrator be connected using a root account (i.e. 
uid == 0).

When executed, \fBsmbd\fR will automatically invoke the

\fBdelete user script (G)\fR
This is the full pathname to a script that will 
be run \fBAS ROOT\fR by  \fBsmbd(8)\fRunder special circumstances 
described below.

Normally, a Samba server requires that UNIX users are 
created for all users accessing files on this server. For sites 
that use Windows NT account databases as their primary user database 
creating these users and keeping the user list in sync with the 
Windows NT PDC is an onerous task. This option allows \fB smbd\fR to delete the required UNIX users \fBON 
DEMAND\fR when a user accesses the Samba server and the 
Windows NT user no longer exists.

In order to use this option, \fBsmbd\fR must be 
set to \fIsecurity = domain\fR or \fIsecurity =
user\fR and \fIdelete user script\fR 
must be set to a full pathname for a script 
that will delete a UNIX user given one argument of \fI%u\fR, 
which expands into the UNIX user name to delete.

When the Windows user attempts to access the Samba server, 
at \fBlogin\fR (session setup in the SMB protocol) 
time, \fBsmbd\fR contacts the  \fIpassword server\fR and attempts to authenticate 
the given user with the given password. If the authentication fails 
with the specific Domain error code meaning that the user no longer 
exists then \fBsmbd\fR attempts to find a UNIX user in 
the UNIX password database that matches the Windows user account. If 
this lookup succeeds, and \fIdelete user script\fR is 
set then \fBsmbd\fR will all the specified script 
\fBAS ROOT\fR, expanding any \fI%u\fR 
argument to be the user name to delete.

This script should delete the given UNIX username. In this way, 
UNIX users are dynamically deleted to match existing Windows NT 
accounts.

See also security = domain,
\fIpassword server\fR

\fBdelete veto files (S)\fR
This option is used when Samba is attempting to 
delete a directory that contains one or more vetoed directories 
(see the \fIveto files\fR
option). If this option is set to false (the default) then if a vetoed 
directory contains any non-vetoed files or directories then the 
directory delete will fail. This is usually what you want.

If this option is set to true, then Samba 
will attempt to recursively delete any files and directories within 
the vetoed directory. This can be useful for integration with file 
serving systems such as NetAtalk which create meta-files within 
directories you might normally veto DOS/Windows users from seeing 
(e.g. \fI.AppleDouble\fR)

Setting \fBdelete veto files = yes\fR allows these 
directories to be transparently deleted when the parent directory 
is deleted (so long as the user has permissions to do so).

See also the \fIveto 
files\fR parameter.

Default: \fBdelete veto files = no\fR
.TP
\fBdeny hosts (S)\fR
Synonym for \fIhosts

\fBdfree command (G)\fR
The \fIdfree command\fR setting should 
only be used on systems where a problem occurs with the internal 
disk space calculations. This has been known to happen with Ultrix, 
but may occur with other operating systems. The symptom that was 
seen was an error of "Abort Retry Ignore" at the end of each 
directory listing.

This setting allows the replacement of the internal routines to
calculate the total disk space and amount available with an external
routine. The example below gives a possible script that might fulfill
this function.

The external program will be passed a single parameter indicating 
a directory in the filesystem being queried. This will typically consist
of the string \fI./\fR. The script should return two 
integers in ASCII. The first should be the total disk space in blocks, 
and the second should be the number of available blocks. An optional 
third return value can give the block size in bytes. The default 
blocksize is 1024 bytes.

Note: Your script should \fBNOT\fR be setuid or 
setgid and should be owned by (and writeable only by) root!

Default: \fBBy default internal routines for 
determining the disk capacity and remaining space will be used.
\fR
Example: \fBdfree command = /usr/local/samba/bin/dfree

Where the script dfree (which must be made executable) could be:

.sp

\fBdirectory mask (S)\fR
This parameter is the octal modes which are 
used when converting DOS modes to UNIX modes when creating UNIX 
directories.

When a directory is created, the necessary permissions are 
calculated according to the mapping from DOS modes to UNIX permissions, 
and the resulting UNIX mode is then bit-wise 'AND'ed with this 
parameter. This parameter may be thought of as a bit-wise MASK for 
the UNIX modes of a directory. Any bit \fBnot\fR set 
here will be removed from the modes set on a directory when it is 
created.

The default value of this parameter removes the 'group' 
and 'other' write bits from the UNIX mode, allowing only the 
user who owns the directory to modify it.

Following this Samba will bit-wise 'OR' the UNIX mode 
created from this parameter with the value of the \fIforce directory mode
\fRparameter. This parameter is set to 000 by 
default (i.e. no extra mode bits are added).

Note that this parameter does not apply to permissions
set by Windows NT/2000 ACL editors. If the administrator wishes to enforce
a mask on access control lists also, they need to set the \fIdirectory security mask\fR.

See the \fIforce 
directory mode\fR parameter to cause particular mode 
bits to always be set on created directories.

See also the \fIcreate mode

.TP
\fBdirectory security mask (S)\fR
This parameter controls what UNIX permission bits 
can be modified when a Windows NT client is manipulating the UNIX 
permission on a directory using the native NT security dialog 
box.

This parameter is applied as a mask (AND'ed with) to 
the changed permission bits, thus preventing any bits not in 
this mask from being modified. Essentially, zero bits in this 
mask may be treated as a set of bits the user is not allowed 
to change.

If not set explicitly this parameter is set to 0777
meaning a user is allowed to modify all the user/group/world
permissions on a directory.

\fBNote\fR that users who can access the 
Samba server through other means can easily bypass this restriction, 
so it is primarily useful for standalone "appliance" systems. 
Administrators of most normal systems will probably want to leave
it as the default of 0777.

See also the \fI force directory security mode\fR, \fIsecurity mask\fR,

\fBdisable spoolss (G)\fR
Enabling this parameter will disables Samba's support
for the SPOOLSS set of MS-RPC's and will yield identical behavior
as Samba 2.0.x. Windows NT/2000 clients will downgrade to using
Lanman style printing commands. Windows 9x/ME will be uneffected by
the parameter. However, this will also disable the ability to upload
printer drivers to a Samba server via the Windows NT Add Printer
Wizard or by using the NT printer properties dialog window. It will
also disable the capability of Windows NT/2000 clients to download
print drivers from the Samba host upon demand.

the name-querying client.

Note that the maximum length for a NetBIOS name is 15 
characters, so the DNS name (or DNS alias) can likewise only be 
15 characters, maximum.

\fBnmbd\fR spawns a second copy of itself to do the

Please note that this parameter has a somewhat confusing name. It 
accepts a list of usernames and of group names in standard 
\fIsmb.conf\fR notation.

See also \fIdomain
guest group\fR, \fIdomain
logons\fR

Default: \fBno domain administrators\fR

Example: \fBdomain admin group = root @wheel\fR
.TP
\fBdomain guest group (G)\fR
This parameter is intended as a temporary solution
to enable users to be a member of the "Domain Guests" group when 
a Samba host is acting as a PDC. A complete solution will be provided
by a system for mapping Windows NT/2000 groups onto UNIX groups.
Please note that this parameter has a somewhat confusing name. It 
accepts a list of usernames and of group names in standard 
\fIsmb.conf\fR notation.

See also \fIdomain
admin group\fR, \fIdomain
logons\fR

Default: \fBno domain guests\fR

Example: \fBdomain guest group = nobody @guest\fR
.TP
\fBdomain logons (G)\fR
If set to true, the Samba server will serve 
Windows 95/98 Domain logons for the  \fIworkgroup\fR it is in. Samba 2.2 also 
has limited capability to act as a domain controller for Windows 
NT 4 Domains. For more details on setting up this feature see 
the Samba-PDC-HOWTO included in the \fIhtmldocs/\fR
directory shipped with the source code.

Default: \fBdomain logons = no\fR
.TP
\fBdomain master (G)\fR
Tell \fB nmbd(8)\fRto enable WAN-wide browse list
collation. Setting this option causes \fBnmbd\fR to
claim a special domain specific NetBIOS name that identifies 
it as a domain master browser for its given  \fIworkgroup\fR. Local master browsers 
in the same \fIworkgroup\fR on broadcast-isolated 
subnets will give this \fBnmbd\fR their local browse lists, 
and then ask \fBsmbd(8)\fR
for a complete copy of the browse list for the whole wide area 
network. Browser clients will then contact their local master browser, 
and will receive the domain-wide browse list, instead of just the list 
for their broadcast-isolated subnet.

Note that Windows NT Primary Domain Controllers expect to be 
able to claim this \fIworkgroup\fR specific special 
NetBIOS name that identifies them as domain master browsers for 
that \fIworkgroup\fR by default (i.e. there is no 
way to prevent a Windows NT PDC from attempting to do this). This 
means that if this parameter is set and \fBnmbd\fR claims 
the special name for a \fIworkgroup\fR before a Windows 
NT PDC is able to do so then cross subnet browsing will behave 
strangely and may fail.

If \fBdomain logons = yes\fR
, then the default behavior is to enable the \fIdomain 
master\fR parameter. If \fIdomain logons\fR is 
not enabled (the default setting), then neither will \fIdomain 
master\fR be enabled by default.

Default: \fBdomain master = auto\fR
.TP
\fBdont descend (S)\fR
There are certain directories on some systems 
(e.g., the \fI/proc\fR tree under Linux) that are either not 
of interest to clients or are infinitely deep (recursive). This 
parameter allows you to specify a comma-delimited list of directories 
that the server should always show as empty.

Note that Samba can be very fussy about the exact format 
of the "dont descend" entries. For example you may need \fI ./proc\fR instead of just \fI/proc\fR. 
Experimentation is the best policy :-) 

Default: \fBnone (i.e., all directories are OK 
to descend)\fR

Example: \fBdont descend = /proc,/dev\fR
.TP
\fBdos filemode (S)\fR
The default behavior in Samba is to provide 
UNIX-like behavior where only the owner of a file/directory is 
able to change the permissions on it. However, this behavior
is often confusing to DOS/Windows users. Enabling this parameter 
allows a user who has write access to the file (by whatever 
means) to modify the permissions on it. Note that a user
belonging to the group owning the file will not be allowed to
change permissions if the group is only granted read access.
Ownership of the file/directory is not changed, only the permissions 
are modified.

Default: \fBdos filemode = no\fR
.TP
\fBdos filetime resolution (S)\fR
Under the DOS and Windows FAT filesystem, the finest 
granularity on time resolution is two seconds. Setting this parameter 
for a share causes Samba to round the reported time down to the 
nearest two second boundary when a query call that requires one second 
resolution is made to \fBsmbd(8)\fR
.

This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual 
C++ when used against Samba shares. If oplocks are enabled on a 
share, Visual C++ uses two different time reading calls to check if a 
file has changed since it was last read. One of these calls uses a
one-second granularity, the other uses a two second granularity. As
the two second call rounds any odd second down, then if the file has a
timestamp of an odd number of seconds then the two timestamps will not
match and Visual C++ will keep reporting the file has changed. Setting
this option causes the two timestamps to match, and Visual C++ is
happy.

Default: \fBdos filetime resolution = no\fR
.TP
\fBdos filetimes (S)\fR
Under DOS and Windows, if a user can write to a 
file they can change the timestamp on it. Under POSIX semantics, 
only the owner of the file or root may change the timestamp. By 
default, Samba runs with POSIX semantics and refuses to change the 
timestamp on a file if the user \fBsmbd\fR is acting 
on behalf of is not the file owner. Setting this option to  true allows DOS semantics and smbdwill change the file 
timestamp as DOS requires.

Default: \fBdos filetimes = no\fR
.TP
\fBencrypt passwords (G)\fR
This boolean controls whether encrypted passwords 
will be negotiated with the client. Note that Windows NT 4.0 SP3 and 
above and also Windows 98 will by default expect encrypted passwords 
unless a registry entry is changed. To use encrypted passwords in 
Samba see the file ENCRYPTION.txt in the Samba documentation 
directory \fIdocs/\fR shipped with the source code.

In order for encrypted passwords to work correctly
\fBsmbd(8)\fRmust either 
have access to a local \fIsmbpasswd(5)
\fRprogram for information on how to set up 
and maintain this file), or set the security = [server|domain] parameter which 
causes \fBsmbd\fR to authenticate against another 
server.

Default: \fBencrypt passwords = no\fR
.TP
\fBenhanced browsing (G)\fR
This option enables a couple of enhancements to 
cross-subnet browse propagation that have been added in Samba 
but which are not standard in Microsoft implementations. 

The first enhancement to browse propagation consists of a regular
wildcard query to a Samba WINS server for all Domain Master Browsers,
followed by a browse synchronization with each of the returned
DMBs. The second enhancement consists of a regular randomised browse
synchronization with all currently known DMBs.

You may wish to disable this option if you have a problem with empty
workgroups not disappearing from browse lists. Due to the restrictions
of the browse protocols these enhancements can cause a empty workgroup
to stay around forever which can be annoying.

In general you should leave this option enabled as it makes
cross-subnet browse propagation much more reliable.

Default: \fBenhanced browsing = yes\fR
.TP
\fBenumports command (G)\fR
The concept of a "port" is fairly foreign
to UNIX hosts. Under Windows NT/2000 print servers, a port
is associated with a port monitor and generally takes the form of
a local port (i.e. LPT1:, COM1:, FILE:) or a remote port
(i.e. LPD Port Monitor, etc...). By default, Samba has only one
port defined--"Samba Printer Port". Under 
Windows NT/2000, all printers must have a valid port name. 
If you wish to have a list of ports displayed (\fBsmbd
\fRdoes not use a port name for anything) other than 
the default "Samba Printer Port", you 
can define \fIenumports command\fR to point to
a program which should generate a list of ports, one per line,
to standard output. This listing will then be used in response
to the level 1 and 2 EnumPorts() RPC.

Default: \fBno enumports command\fR

Example: \fBenumports command = /usr/bin/listports
\fR.TP
\fBexec (S)\fR
This is a synonym for  \fIpreexec\fR.
.TP
\fBfake directory create times (S)\fR
NTFS and Windows VFAT file systems keep a create 
time for all files and directories. This is not the same as the 
ctime - status change time - that Unix keeps, so Samba by default 
reports the earliest of the various times Unix does keep. Setting 
this parameter for a share causes Samba to always report midnight 
1-1-1980 as the create time for directories.

This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for 
Visual C++ when used against Samba shares. Visual C++ generated 
makefiles have the object directory as a dependency for each object 
file, and a make rule to create the directory. Also, when NMAKE 
compares timestamps it uses the creation time when examining a 
directory. Thus the object directory will be created if it does not 
exist, but once it does exist it will always have an earlier 
timestamp than the object files it contains.

However, Unix time semantics mean that the create time 
reported by Samba will be updated whenever a file is created or 
or deleted in the directory. NMAKE finds all object files in 
the object directory. The timestamp of the last one built is then 
compared to the timestamp of the object directory. If the 
directory's timestamp if newer, then all object files
will be rebuilt. Enabling this option 
ensures directories always predate their contents and an NMAKE build 
will proceed as expected.

Default: \fBfake directory create times = no\fR
.TP
\fBfake oplocks (S)\fR
Oplocks are the way that SMB clients get permission 
from a server to locally cache file operations. If a server grants 
an oplock (opportunistic lock) then the client is free to assume 
that it is the only one accessing the file and it will aggressively 
cache file data. With some oplock types the client may even cache 
file open/close operations. This can give enormous performance benefits.

When you set \fBfake oplocks = yes\fR, \fBsmbd(8)\fRwill
always grant oplock requests no matter how many clients are using 
the file.

It is generally much better to use the real \fIoplocks\fR support rather 
than this parameter.

If you enable this option on all read-only shares or 
shares that you know will only be accessed from one client at a 
time such as physically read-only media like CDROMs, you will see 
a big performance improvement on many operations. If you enable 
this option on shares where multiple clients may be accessing the 
files read-write at the same time you can get data corruption. Use 
this option carefully!

Default: \fBfake oplocks = no\fR
.TP
\fBfollow symlinks (S)\fR
This parameter allows the Samba administrator 
to stop \fBsmbd(8)\fR
from following symbolic links in a particular share. Setting this 
parameter to no prevents any file or directory 
that is a symbolic link from being followed (the user will get an 
error). This option is very useful to stop users from adding a 
symbolic link to \fI/etc/passwd\fR in their home 
directory for instance. However it will slow filename lookups 
down slightly.

This option is enabled (i.e. \fBsmbd\fR will 
follow symbolic links) by default.

Default: \fBfollow symlinks = yes\fR
.TP
\fBforce create mode (S)\fR
This parameter specifies a set of UNIX mode bit 
permissions that will \fBalways\fR be set on a 
file created by Samba. This is done by bitwise 'OR'ing these bits onto 
the mode bits of a file that is being created or having its 
permissions changed. The default for this parameter is (in octal) 
000. The modes in this parameter are bitwise 'OR'ed onto the file 
mode after the mask set in the \fIcreate mask\fR 
parameter is applied.

See also the parameter \fIcreate 
mask\fR for details on masking mode bits on files.

See also the \fIinherit 
permissions\fR parameter.

Default: \fBforce create mode = 000\fR

Example: \fBforce create mode = 0755\fR

would force all created files to have read and execute 
permissions set for 'group' and 'other' as well as the 
read/write/execute bits set for the 'user'.
.TP
\fBforce directory mode (S)\fR
This parameter specifies a set of UNIX mode bit 
permissions that will \fBalways\fR be set on a directory 
created by Samba. This is done by bitwise 'OR'ing these bits onto the 
mode bits of a directory that is being created. The default for this 
parameter is (in octal) 0000 which will not add any extra permission 
bits to a created directory. This operation is done after the mode 
mask in the parameter \fIdirectory mask\fR is 
applied.

See also the parameter \fI directory mask\fR for details on masking mode bits 
on created directories.

See also the \fI inherit permissions\fR parameter.

Default: \fBforce directory mode = 000\fR

Example: \fBforce directory mode = 0755\fR

would force all created directories to have read and execute
permissions set for 'group' and 'other' as well as the
read/write/execute bits set for the 'user'.
.TP
\fBforce directory  security mode (S)\fR
This parameter controls what UNIX permission bits 
can be modified when a Windows NT client is manipulating the UNIX 
permission on a directory using the native NT security dialog box.

This parameter is applied as a mask (OR'ed with) to the 
changed permission bits, thus forcing any bits in this mask that 
the user may have modified to be on. Essentially, one bits in this 
mask may be treated as a set of bits that, when modifying security 
on a directory, the user has always set to be 'on'.

If not set explicitly this parameter is 000, which 
allows a user to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a 
directory without restrictions.

\fBNote\fR that users who can access the 
Samba server through other means can easily bypass this restriction, 
so it is primarily useful for standalone "appliance" systems. 
Administrators of most normal systems will probably want to leave
it set as 0000.

See also the \fI directory security mask\fR,  \fIsecurity mask\fR, 
\fIforce security mode
\fRparameters.

Default: \fBforce directory security mode = 0\fR

Example: \fBforce directory security mode = 700\fR
.TP
\fBforce group (S)\fR
This specifies a UNIX group name that will be 
assigned as the default primary group for all users connecting 
to this service. This is useful for sharing files by ensuring 
that all access to files on service will use the named group for 
their permissions checking. Thus, by assigning permissions for this 
group to the files and directories within this service the Samba 
administrator can restrict or allow sharing of these files.

In Samba 2.0.5 and above this parameter has extended 
functionality in the following way. If the group name listed here 
has a '+' character prepended to it then the current user accessing 
the share only has the primary group default assigned to this group 
if they are already assigned as a member of that group. This allows 
an administrator to decide that only users who are already in a 
particular group will create files with group ownership set to that 
group. This gives a finer granularity of ownership assignment. For 
example, the setting \fIforce group = +sys\fR means 
that only users who are already in group sys will have their default
primary group assigned to sys when accessing this Samba share. All
other users will retain their ordinary primary group.

If the \fIforce user
\fRparameter is also set the group specified in 
\fIforce group\fR will override the primary group
set in \fIforce user\fR.

See also \fIforce 
user\fR.

Default: \fBno forced group\fR

Example: \fBforce group = agroup\fR
.TP
\fBforce security mode (S)\fR
This parameter controls what UNIX permission 
bits can be modified when a Windows NT client is manipulating 
the UNIX permission on a file using the native NT security dialog 
box.

This parameter is applied as a mask (OR'ed with) to the 
changed permission bits, thus forcing any bits in this mask that 
the user may have modified to be on. Essentially, one bits in this 
mask may be treated as a set of bits that, when modifying security 
on a file, the user has always set to be 'on'.

If not set explicitly this parameter is set to 0,
and allows a user to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a file,
with no restrictions.

\fBNote\fR that users who can access 
the Samba server through other means can easily bypass this restriction, 
so it is primarily useful for standalone "appliance" systems. 
Administrators of most normal systems will probably want to leave
this set to 0000.

See also the \fI force directory security mode\fR,
\fIdirectory security
mask\fR, \fI security mask\fR parameters.

Default: \fBforce security mode = 0\fR

Example: \fBforce security mode = 700\fR
.TP
\fBforce user (S)\fR
This specifies a UNIX user name that will be 
assigned as the default user for all users connecting to this service. 
This is useful for sharing files. You should also use it carefully 
as using it incorrectly can cause security problems.

This user name only gets used once a connection is established. 
Thus clients still need to connect as a valid user and supply a 
valid password. Once connected, all file operations will be performed 
as the "forced user", no matter what username the client connected 
as. This can be very useful.

In Samba 2.0.5 and above this parameter also causes the 
primary group of the forced user to be used as the primary group 
for all file activity. Prior to 2.0.5 the primary group was left 
as the primary group of the connecting user (this was a bug).

See also \fIforce group
\fR
Default: \fBno forced user\fR

Example: \fBforce user = auser\fR
.TP
\fBfstype (S)\fR
This parameter allows the administrator to 
configure the string that specifies the type of filesystem a share 
is using that is reported by \fBsmbd(8)
\fRwhen a client queries the filesystem type
for a share. The default type is NTFS for 
compatibility with Windows NT but this can be changed to other 
strings such as Samba or FAT
if required.

Default: \fBfstype = NTFS\fR

Example: \fBfstype = Samba\fR
.TP
\fBgetwd cache (G)\fR
This is a tuning option. When this is enabled a 
caching algorithm will be used to reduce the time taken for getwd() 
calls. This can have a significant impact on performance, especially 
when the \fIwide links\fR
parameter is set to false.

Default: \fBgetwd cache = yes\fR
.TP
\fBgroup (S)\fR
Synonym for \fIforce 
group\fR.
.TP
\fBguest account (S)\fR
This is a username which will be used for access 
to services which are specified as \fI guest ok\fR (see below). Whatever privileges this 
user has will be available to any client connecting to the guest service. 
Typically this user will exist in the password file, but will not
have a valid login. The user account "ftp" is often a good choice 
for this parameter. If a username is specified in a given service, 
the specified username overrides this one.

One some systems the default guest account "nobody" may not 
be able to print. Use another account in this case. You should test 
this by trying to log in as your guest user (perhaps by using the 
\fBsu -\fR command) and trying to print using the 
system print command such as \fBlpr(1)\fR or \fB lp(1)\fR.

Default: \fBspecified at compile time, usually 
"nobody"\fR

Example: \fBguest account = ftp\fR
.TP
\fBguest ok (S)\fR
If this parameter is yes for 
a service, then no password is required to connect to the service. 
Privileges will be those of the \fI guest account\fR.

See the section below on \fI security\fR for more information about this option.

Default: \fBguest ok = no\fR
.TP
\fBguest only (S)\fR
If this parameter is yes for 
a service, then only guest connections to the service are permitted. 
This parameter will have no effect if  \fIguest ok\fR is not set for the service.

See the section below on \fI security\fR for more information about this option.

Default: \fBguest only = no\fR
.TP
\fBhide dot files (S)\fR
This is a boolean parameter that controls whether 
files starting with a dot appear as hidden files.

Default: \fBhide dot files = yes\fR
.TP
\fBhide files(S)\fR
This is a list of files or directories that are not 
visible but are accessible. The DOS 'hidden' attribute is applied 
to any files or directories that match.

Each entry in the list must be separated by a '/', 
which allows spaces to be included in the entry. '*'
and '?' can be used to specify multiple files or directories 
as in DOS wildcards.

Each entry must be a Unix path, not a DOS path and must 
not include the Unix directory separator '/'.

Note that the case sensitivity option is applicable 
in hiding files.

Setting this parameter will affect the performance of Samba, 
as it will be forced to check all files and directories for a match 
as they are scanned.

See also \fIhide 
dot files\fR, \fI veto files\fR and  \fIcase sensitive\fR.

Default: \fBno file are hidden\fR

Example: \fBhide files =
/.*/DesktopFolderDB/TrashFor%m/resource.frk/\fR

The above example is based on files that the Macintosh 
SMB client (DAVE) available from  
Thursby <URL:http://www.thursby.com> creates for internal use, and also still hides 
all files beginning with a dot.
.TP
\fBhide local users(G)\fR
This parameter toggles the hiding of local UNIX 
users (root, wheel, floppy, etc) from remote clients.

Default: \fBhide local users = no\fR
.TP
\fBhide unreadable (S)\fR
This parameter prevents clients from seeing the
existance of files that cannot be read. Defaults to off.

Default: \fBhide unreadable = no\fR
.TP
\fBhomedir map (G)\fR
If\fInis homedir
\fRis true, and \fBsmbd(8)\fRis also acting 
as a Win95/98 \fIlogon server\fR then this parameter 
specifies the NIS (or YP) map from which the server for the user's 
home directory should be extracted. At present, only the Sun 
auto.home map format is understood. The form of the map is:

\fBusername server:/some/file/system\fR

and the program will extract the servername from before 
the first ':'. There should probably be a better parsing system 
that copes with different map formats and also Amd (another 
automounter) maps.

\fBNOTE :\fRA working NIS client is required on 
the system for this option to work.

See also \fInis homedir\fR
, \fIdomain logons\fR
\&.

Default: \fBhomedir map = <empty string>\fR

Example: \fBhomedir map = amd.homedir\fR
.TP
\fBhost msdfs (G)\fR
This boolean parameter is only available 
if Samba has been configured and compiled with the \fB --with-msdfs\fR option. If set to yes, 
Samba will act as a Dfs server, and allow Dfs-aware clients 
to browse Dfs trees hosted on the server.

See also the \fI msdfs root\fR share level parameter. For
more information on setting up a Dfs tree on Samba,
refer to msdfs_setup.html.

Default: \fBhost msdfs = no\fR
.TP
\fBhosts allow (S)\fR
A synonym for this parameter is \fIallow 
hosts\fR.

This parameter is a comma, space, or tab delimited 
set of hosts which are permitted to access a service.

If specified in the [global] section then it will
apply to all services, regardless of whether the individual 
service has a different setting.

You can specify the hosts by name or IP number. For 
example, you could restrict access to only the hosts on a 
Class C subnet with something like \fBallow hosts = 150.203.5.
\fR\&. The full syntax of the list is described in the man 
page \fIhosts_access(5)\fR. Note that this man
page may not be present on your system, so a brief description will
be given here also.

Note that the localhost address 127.0.0.1 will always 
be allowed access unless specifically denied by a \fIhosts deny\fR option.

You can also specify hosts by network/netmask pairs and 
by netgroup names if your system supports netgroups. The 
\fBEXCEPT\fR keyword can also be used to limit a 
wildcard list. The following examples may provide some help:

Example 1: allow all IPs in 150.203.*.*; except one

\fBhosts allow = 150.203. EXCEPT 150.203.6.66\fR

Example 2: allow hosts that match the given network/netmask

\fBhosts allow = 150.203.15.0/255.255.255.0\fR

Example 3: allow a couple of hosts

\fBhosts allow = lapland, arvidsjaur\fR

Example 4: allow only hosts in NIS netgroup "foonet", but 
deny access from one particular host

\fBhosts allow = @foonet\fR

\fBhosts deny = pirate\fR

Note that access still requires suitable user-level passwords.

See \fBtestparm(1)\fR
for a way of testing your host access to see if it does 
what you expect.

Default: \fBnone (i.e., all hosts permitted access)
\fR
Example: \fBallow hosts = 150.203.5. myhost.mynet.edu.au
\fR.TP
\fBhosts deny (S)\fR
The opposite of \fIhosts allow\fR 
- hosts listed here are \fBNOT\fR permitted access to 
services unless the specific services have their own lists to override 
this one. Where the lists conflict, the \fIallow\fR 
list takes precedence.

Default: \fBnone (i.e., no hosts specifically excluded)
\fR
Example: \fBhosts deny = 150.203.4. badhost.mynet.edu.au
\fR.TP
\fBhosts equiv (G)\fR
If this global parameter is a non-null string, 
it specifies the name of a file to read for the names of hosts 
and users who will be allowed access without specifying a password.

This is not be confused with  \fIhosts allow\fR which is about hosts 
access to services and is more useful for guest services. \fI hosts equiv\fR may be useful for NT clients which will 
not supply passwords to Samba.

\fBNOTE :\fR The use of \fIhosts equiv
\fRcan be a major security hole. This is because you are 
trusting the PC to supply the correct username. It is very easy to 
get a PC to supply a false username. I recommend that the 
\fIhosts equiv\fR option be only used if you really 
know what you are doing, or perhaps on a home network where you trust 
your spouse and kids. And only if you \fBreally\fR trust 
them :-).

Default: \fBno host equivalences\fR

Example: \fBhosts equiv = /etc/hosts.equiv\fR
.TP
\fBinclude (G)\fR
This allows you to include one config file 
inside another. The file is included literally, as though typed 
in place.

It takes the standard substitutions, except \fI%u
\fR, \fI%P\fR and \fI%S\fR.

Default: \fBno file included\fR

Example: \fBinclude = /usr/local/samba/lib/admin_smb.conf
\fR.TP
\fBinherit permissions (S)\fR
The permissions on new files and directories 
are normally governed by \fI create mask\fR,  \fIdirectory mask\fR, \fIforce create mode\fR
and \fIforce 
directory mode\fR but the boolean inherit 
permissions parameter overrides this.

New directories inherit the mode of the parent directory,
including bits such as setgid.

New files inherit their read/write bits from the parent 
directory. Their execute bits continue to be determined by
\fImap archive\fR
, \fImap hidden\fR
and \fImap system\fR
as usual.

Note that the setuid bit is \fBnever\fR set via 
inheritance (the code explicitly prohibits this).

This can be particularly useful on large systems with 
many users, perhaps several thousand, to allow a single [homes] 
share to be used flexibly by each user.

See also \fIcreate mask
\fR, \fI directory mask\fR,  \fIforce create mode\fR and \fIforce directory mode\fR
\&.

Default: \fBinherit permissions = no\fR
.TP
\fBinterfaces (G)\fR
This option allows you to override the default 
network interfaces list that Samba will use for browsing, name 
registration and other NBT traffic. By default Samba will query 
the kernel for the list of all active interfaces and use any 
interfaces except 127.0.0.1 that are broadcast capable.

The option takes a list of interface strings. Each string 
can be in any of the following forms:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
a network interface name (such as eth0). 
This may include shell-like wildcards so eth* will match 
any interface starting with the substring "eth"
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
an IP address. In this case the netmask is 
determined from the list of interfaces obtained from the 
kernel
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
an IP/mask pair. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
a broadcast/mask pair.

\fBinvalid users (S)\fR
This is a list of users that should not be allowed 
to login to this service. This is really a \fBparanoid\fR 
check to absolutely ensure an improper setting does not breach 
your security.

A name starting with a '@' is interpreted as an NIS 
netgroup first (if your system supports NIS), and then as a UNIX 
group if the name was not found in the NIS netgroup database.

A name starting with '+' is interpreted only 
by looking in the UNIX group database. A name starting with 
\&'&' is interpreted only by looking in the NIS netgroup database 
(this requires NIS to be working on your system). The characters 
\&'+' and '&' may be used at the start of the name in either order 
so the value \fI+&group\fR means check the 
UNIX group database, followed by the NIS netgroup database, and 
the value \fI&+group\fR means check the NIS
netgroup database, followed by the UNIX group database (the 
same as the '@' prefix).

The current servicename is substituted for \fI%S\fR. 
This is useful in the [homes] section.

See also \fIvalid users
\fR\&.

Default: \fBno invalid users\fR

Example: \fBinvalid users = root fred admin @wheel
\fR.TP
\fBkeepalive (G)\fR
The value of the parameter (an integer) represents 
the number of seconds between \fIkeepalive\fR 
packets. If this parameter is zero, no keepalive packets will be 
sent. Keepalive packets, if sent, allow the server to tell whether 
a client is still present and responding.

Keepalives should, in general, not be needed if the socket 
being used has the SO_KEEPALIVE attribute set on it (see \fIsocket options\fR). 
Basically you should only use this option if you strike difficulties.

Default: \fBkeepalive = 300\fR

Example: \fBkeepalive = 600\fR
.TP
\fBkernel oplocks (G)\fR
For UNIXes that support kernel based \fIoplocks\fR
(currently only IRIX and the Linux 2.4 kernel), this parameter 
allows the use of them to be turned on or off.

Kernel oplocks support allows Samba \fIoplocks
\fRto be broken whenever a local UNIX process or NFS operation 
accesses a file that \fBsmbd(8)\fR
has oplocked. This allows complete data consistency between 
SMB/CIFS, NFS and local file access (and is a \fBvery\fR 
cool feature :-).

This parameter defaults to on, but is translated
to a no-op on systems that no not have the necessary kernel support.
You should never need to touch this parameter.

See also the \fIoplocks\fR
and \fIlevel2 oplocks
\fRparameters.

Default: \fBkernel oplocks = yes\fR
.TP
\fBlanman auth (G)\fR
This parameter determines whether or not smbdwill
attempt to authenticate users using the LANMAN password hash.
If disabled, only clients which support NT password hashes (e.g. Windows 
NT/2000 clients, smbclient, etc... but not Windows 95/98 or the MS DOS 
network client) will be able to connect to the Samba host.

Default : \fBlanman auth = yes\fR
.TP
\fBlarge readwrite (G)\fR
This parameter determines whether or not smbd
supports the new 64k streaming read and write varient SMB requests introduced
with Windows 2000. Note that due to Windows 2000 client redirector bugs
this requires Samba to be running on a 64-bit capable operating system such
as IRIX, Solaris or a Linux 2.4 kernel. Can improve performance by 10% with
Windows 2000 clients. Defaults to off. Not as tested as some other Samba
code paths.

Default : \fBlarge readwrite = no\fR
.TP
\fBldap admin dn (G)\fR
This parameter is only available if Samba has been
configure to include the \fB--with-ldapsam\fR option
at compile time. This option should be considered experimental and
under active development.

The \fIldap admin dn\fR defines the Distinguished 
Name (DN) name used by Samba to contact the ldap
server when retreiving user account information. The \fIldap
admin dn\fR is used in conjunction with the admin dn password
stored in the \fIprivate/secrets.tdb\fR file. See the
\fBsmbpasswd(8)\fRman
page for more information on how to accmplish this.

Default : \fBnone\fR
.TP
\fBldap filter (G)\fR
This parameter is only available if Samba has been
configure to include the \fB--with-ldapsam\fR option
at compile time. This option should be considered experimental and
under active development.

This parameter specifies the RFC 2254 compliant LDAP search filter.
The default is to match the login name with the uid 
attribute for all entries matching the sambaAccount 
objectclass. Note that this filter should only return one entry.

Default : \fBldap filter = (&(uid=%u)(objectclass=sambaAccount))\fR
.TP
\fBldap port (G)\fR
This parameter is only available if Samba has been
configure to include the \fB--with-ldapsam\fR option
at compile time. This option should be considered experimental and
under active development.

This option is used to control the tcp port number used to contact
the \fIldap server\fR.
The default is to use the stand LDAPS port 636.

See Also: ldap ssl

Default : \fBldap port = 636\fR
.TP
\fBldap server (G)\fR
This parameter is only available if Samba has been
configure to include the \fB--with-ldapsam\fR option
at compile time. This option should be considered experimental and
under active development.

This parameter should contains the FQDN of the ldap directory 
server which should be queried to locate user account information.

Default : \fBldap server = localhost\fR
.TP
\fBldap ssl (G)\fR
This parameter is only available if Samba has been
configure to include the \fB--with-ldapsam\fR option
at compile time. This option should be considered experimental and
under active development.

This option is used to define whether or not Samba should
use SSL when connecting to the \fIldap
server\fR. This is \fBNOT\fR related to
Samba SSL support which is enabled by specifying the 
\fB--with-ssl\fR option to the \fIconfigure\fR 
script (see \fIssl\fR).

The \fIldap ssl\fR can be set to one of three values:
(a) on - Always use SSL when contacting the 
\fIldap server\fR, (b) off -
Never use SSL when querying the directory, or (c) start_tls 
- Use the LDAPv3 StartTLS extended operation 
(RFC2830) for communicating with the directory server.

Default : \fBldap ssl = on\fR
.TP
\fBldap suffix (G)\fR
This parameter is only available if Samba has been
configure to include the \fB--with-ldapsam\fR option
at compile time. This option should be considered experimental and
under active development.

Default : \fBnone\fR
.TP
\fBlevel2 oplocks (S)\fR
This parameter controls whether Samba supports
level2 (read-only) oplocks on a share.

Level2, or read-only oplocks allow Windows NT clients 
that have an oplock on a file to downgrade from a read-write oplock 
to a read-only oplock once a second client opens the file (instead 
of releasing all oplocks on a second open, as in traditional, 
exclusive oplocks). This allows all openers of the file that 
support level2 oplocks to cache the file for read-ahead only (ie. 
they may not cache writes or lock requests) and increases performance 
for many accesses of files that are not commonly written (such as 
application .EXE files).

Once one of the clients which have a read-only oplock 
writes to the file all clients are notified (no reply is needed 
or waited for) and told to break their oplocks to "none" and 
delete any read-ahead caches.

It is recommended that this parameter be turned on 
to speed access to shared executables.

For more discussions on level2 oplocks see the CIFS spec.

Currently, if \fIkernel 
oplocks\fR are supported then level2 oplocks are 
not granted (even if this parameter is set to yes). 
Note also, the \fIoplocks\fR
parameter must be set to true on this share in order for 
this parameter to have any effect.

See also the \fIoplocks\fR
and \fIkernel oplocks\fR
parameters.

Default: \fBlevel2 oplocks = yes\fR
.TP
\fBlm announce (G)\fR
This parameter determines if  \fBnmbd(8)\fRwill produce Lanman announce 
broadcasts that are needed by OS/2 clients in order for them to see 
the Samba server in their browse list. This parameter can have three 
values, true, false, or
auto. The default is auto. 
If set to false Samba will never produce these 
broadcasts. If set to true Samba will produce 
Lanman announce broadcasts at a frequency set by the parameter 
\fIlm interval\fR. If set to auto 
Samba will not send Lanman announce broadcasts by default but will 
listen for them. If it hears such a broadcast on the wire it will 
then start sending them at a frequency set by the parameter 
\fIlm interval\fR.

See also \fIlm interval
\fR\&.

Default: \fBlm announce = auto\fR

Example: \fBlm announce = yes\fR
.TP
\fBlm interval (G)\fR
If Samba is set to produce Lanman announce 
broadcasts needed by OS/2 clients (see the  \fIlm announce\fR parameter) then this 
parameter defines the frequency in seconds with which they will be 
made. If this is set to zero then no Lanman announcements will be 
made despite the setting of the \fIlm announce\fR 
parameter.

See also \fIlm 
announce\fR.

Default: \fBlm interval = 60\fR

Example: \fBlm interval = 120\fR
.TP
\fBload printers (G)\fR
A boolean variable that controls whether all 
printers in the printcap will be loaded for browsing by default. 
See the printers section for 
more details.

Default: \fBload printers = yes\fR
.TP
\fBlocal master (G)\fR
This option allows \fB nmbd(8)\fRto try and become a local master browser 
on a subnet. If set to false then \fB nmbd\fR will not attempt to become a local master browser 
on a subnet and will also lose in all browsing elections. By
default this value is set to true. Setting this value to true doesn't
mean that Samba will \fBbecome\fR the local master 
browser on a subnet, just that \fBnmbd\fR will \fB participate\fR in elections for local master browser.

Setting this value to false will cause \fBnmbd\fR
\fBnever\fR to become a local master browser.

Default: \fBlocal master = yes\fR
.TP
\fBlock dir (G)\fR
Synonym for \fI lock directory\fR.
.TP
\fBlock directory (G)\fR
This option specifies the directory where lock 
files will be placed. The lock files are used to implement the 
\fImax connections\fR
option.

Default: \fBlock directory = ${prefix}/var/locks\fR

Example: \fBlock directory = /var/run/samba/locks\fR
.TP
\fBlocking (S)\fR
This controls whether or not locking will be 
performed by the server in response to lock requests from the 
client.

If \fBlocking = no\fR, all lock and unlock 
requests will appear to succeed and all lock queries will report 
that the file in question is available for locking.

If \fBlocking = yes\fR, real locking will be performed 
by the server.

This option \fBmay\fR be useful for read-only 
filesystems which \fBmay\fR not need locking (such as 
CDROM drives), although setting this parameter of no 
is not really recommended even in this case.

Be careful about disabling locking either globally or in a 
specific service, as lack of locking may result in data corruption. 
You should never need to set this parameter.

Default: \fBlocking = yes\fR
.TP
\fBlog file (G)\fR
This option allows you to override the name 
of the Samba log file (also known as the debug file).

This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing 
you to have separate log files for each user or machine.

Example: \fBlog file = /usr/local/samba/var/log.%m
\fR.TP
\fBlog level (G)\fR
The value of the parameter (an integer) allows 
the debug level (logging level) to be specified in the 
\fIsmb.conf\fR file. This is to give greater 
flexibility in the configuration of the system.

The default will be the log level specified on 
the command line or level zero if none was specified.

Example: \fBlog level = 3\fR
.TP
\fBlogon drive (G)\fR
This parameter specifies the local path to 
which the home directory will be connected (see \fIlogon home\fR) 
and is only used by NT Workstations. 

Note that this option is only useful if Samba is set up as a
logon server.

Default: \fBlogon drive = z:\fR

Example: \fBlogon drive = h:\fR
.TP
\fBlogon home (G)\fR
This parameter specifies the home directory 
location when a Win95/98 or NT Workstation logs into a Samba PDC. 
It allows you to do 

C:\\> \fBNET USE H: /HOME\fR

from a command prompt, for example.

This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing 
you to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine.

This parameter can be used with Win9X workstations to ensure 
that roaming profiles are stored in a subdirectory of the user's 
home directory. This is done in the following way:

\fBlogon home = \\\\%N\\%U\\profile\fR

This tells Samba to return the above string, with 
substitutions made when a client requests the info, generally 
in a NetUserGetInfo request. Win9X clients truncate the info to
\\\\server\\share when a user does \fBnet use /home\fR
but use the whole string when dealing with profiles.

Note that in prior versions of Samba, the  \fIlogon path\fR was returned rather than 
\fIlogon home\fR. This broke \fBnet use 
/home\fR but allowed profiles outside the home directory. 
The current implementation is correct, and can be used for 
profiles if you use the above trick.

This option is only useful if Samba is set up as a logon 
server.

Default: \fBlogon home = "\\\\%N\\%U"\fR

Example: \fBlogon home = "\\\\remote_smb_server\\%U"\fR
.TP
\fBlogon path (G)\fR
This parameter specifies the home directory 
where roaming profiles (NTuser.dat etc files for Windows NT) are 
stored. Contrary to previous versions of these manual pages, it has 
nothing to do with Win 9X roaming profiles. To find out how to 
handle roaming profiles for Win 9X system, see the  \fIlogon home\fR parameter.

This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you 
to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine. It also 
specifies the directory from which the "Application Data", 
(\fIdesktop\fR, \fIstart menu\fR,
\fInetwork neighborhood\fR, \fIprograms\fR 
and other folders, and their contents, are loaded and displayed on 
your Windows NT client.

The share and the path must be readable by the user for 
the preferences and directories to be loaded onto the Windows NT
client. The share must be writeable when the user logs in for the first
time, in order that the Windows NT client can create the NTuser.dat
and other directories.

Thereafter, the directories and any of the contents can, 
if required, be made read-only. It is not advisable that the 
NTuser.dat file be made read-only - rename it to NTuser.man to 
achieve the desired effect (a \fBMAN\fRdatory 
profile). 

Windows clients can sometimes maintain a connection to 
the [homes] share, even though there is no user logged in. 
Therefore, it is vital that the logon path does not include a 
reference to the homes share (i.e. setting this parameter to
\\%N\\%U\\profile_path will cause problems).

This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing 
you to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine.

Note that this option is only useful if Samba is set up 
as a logon server.

Default: \fBlogon path = \\\\%N\\%U\\profile\fR

Example: \fBlogon path = \\\\PROFILESERVER\\PROFILE\\%U\fR
.TP
\fBlogon script (G)\fR
This parameter specifies the batch file (.bat) or 
NT command file (.cmd) to be downloaded and run on a machine when 
a user successfully logs in. The file must contain the DOS 
style CR/LF line endings. Using a DOS-style editor to create the 
file is recommended.

The script must be a relative path to the [netlogon] 
service. If the [netlogon] service specifies a  \fIpath\fR of \fI/usr/local/samba/netlogon
\fR, and \fBlogon script = STARTUP.BAT\fR, then 
the file that will be downloaded is:

\fI/usr/local/samba/netlogon/STARTUP.BAT\fR

The contents of the batch file are entirely your choice. A 
suggested command would be to add \fBNET TIME \\\\SERVER /SET 
/YES\fR, to force every machine to synchronize clocks with 
the same time server. Another use would be to add \fBNET USE 
U: \\\\SERVER\\UTILS\fR for commonly used utilities, or \fB NET USE Q: \\\\SERVER\\ISO9001_QA\fR for example.

Note that it is particularly important not to allow write 
access to the [netlogon] share, or to grant users write permission 
on the batch files in a secure environment, as this would allow 
the batch files to be arbitrarily modified and security to be 
breached.

This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you 
to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine.

This option is only useful if Samba is set up as a logon 
server.

Default: \fBno logon script defined\fR

Example: \fBlogon script = scripts\\%U.bat\fR
.TP
\fBlppause command (S)\fR
This parameter specifies the command to be 
executed on the server host in order to stop printing or spooling 
a specific print job.

This command should be a program or script which takes 
a printer name and job number to pause the print job. One way 
of implementing this is by using job priorities, where jobs 
having a too low priority won't be sent to the printer.

If a \fI%p\fR is given then the printer name 
is put in its place. A \fI%j\fR is replaced with 
the job number (an integer). On HPUX (see \fIprinting=hpux
\fR), if the \fI-p%p\fR option is added 
to the lpq command, the job will show up with the correct status, i.e. 
if the job priority is lower than the set fence priority it will 
have the PAUSED status, whereas if the priority is equal or higher it 
will have the SPOOLED or PRINTING status.

Note that it is good practice to include the absolute path 
in the lppause command as the PATH may not be available to the server.

See also the \fIprinting
\fRparameter.

Default: Currently no default value is given to 
this string, unless the value of the \fIprinting\fR 
parameter is SYSV, in which case the default is :

\fBlp -i %p-%j -H hold\fR

or if the value of the \fIprinting\fR parameter 
is SOFTQ, then the default is:

\fBqstat -s -j%j -h\fR

Example for HPUX: \fBlppause command = /usr/bin/lpalt 
%p-%j -p0\fR
.TP
\fBlpq cache time (G)\fR
This controls how long lpq info will be cached 
for to prevent the \fBlpq\fR command being called too 
often. A separate cache is kept for each variation of the \fB lpq\fR command used by the system, so if you use different 
\fBlpq\fR commands for different users then they won't
share cache information.

The cache files are stored in \fI/tmp/lpq.xxxx\fR 
where xxxx is a hash of the \fBlpq\fR command in use.

The default is 10 seconds, meaning that the cached results 
of a previous identical \fBlpq\fR command will be used 
if the cached data is less than 10 seconds old. A large value may 
be advisable if your \fBlpq\fR command is very slow.

A value of 0 will disable caching completely.

See also the \fIprinting
\fRparameter.

Default: \fBlpq cache time = 10\fR

Example: \fBlpq cache time = 30\fR
.TP
\fBlpq command (S)\fR
This parameter specifies the command to be 
executed on the server host in order to obtain \fBlpq
\fR-style printer status information.

This command should be a program or script which 
takes a printer name as its only parameter and outputs printer 
status information.

Currently eight styles of printer status information 
are supported; BSD, AIX, LPRNG, PLP, SYSV, HPUX, QNX and SOFTQ. 
This covers most UNIX systems. You control which type is expected 
using the \fIprinting =\fR option.

Some clients (notably Windows for Workgroups) may not 
correctly send the connection number for the printer they are 
requesting status information about. To get around this, the 
server reports on the first printer service connected to by the 
client. This only happens if the connection number sent is invalid.

If a \fI%p\fR is given then the printer name 
is put in its place. Otherwise it is placed at the end of the 
command.

Note that it is good practice to include the absolute path 
in the \fIlpq command\fR as the \fB$PATH
\fRmay not be available to the server.

See also the \fIprinting
\fRparameter.

Default: \fBdepends on the setting of \fI printing\fB\fR

Example: \fBlpq command = /usr/bin/lpq -P%p\fR
.TP
\fBlpresume command (S)\fR
This parameter specifies the command to be 
executed on the server host in order to restart or continue 
printing or spooling a specific print job.

This command should be a program or script which takes 
a printer name and job number to resume the print job. See 
also the \fIlppause command
\fRparameter.

If a \fI%p\fR is given then the printer name 
is put in its place. A \fI%j\fR is replaced with 
the job number (an integer).

Note that it is good practice to include the absolute path 
in the \fIlpresume command\fR as the PATH may not 
be available to the server.

See also the \fIprinting
\fRparameter.

Default: Currently no default value is given 
to this string, unless the value of the \fIprinting\fR 
parameter is SYSV, in which case the default is :

\fBlp -i %p-%j -H resume\fR

or if the value of the \fIprinting\fR parameter 
is SOFTQ, then the default is:

\fBqstat -s -j%j -r\fR

Example for HPUX: \fBlpresume command = /usr/bin/lpalt 
%p-%j -p2\fR
.TP
\fBlprm command (S)\fR
This parameter specifies the command to be 
executed on the server host in order to delete a print job.

This command should be a program or script which takes 
a printer name and job number, and deletes the print job.

If a \fI%p\fR is given then the printer name 
is put in its place. A \fI%j\fR is replaced with 
the job number (an integer).

Note that it is good practice to include the absolute 
path in the \fIlprm command\fR as the PATH may not be 
available to the server.

See also the \fIprinting
\fRparameter.

Default: \fBdepends on the setting of \fIprinting
\fB\fR
Example 1: \fBlprm command = /usr/bin/lprm -P%p %j
\fR
Example 2: \fBlprm command = /usr/bin/cancel %p-%j
\fR.TP
\fBmachine password timeout (G)\fR
If a Samba server is a member of a Windows 
NT Domain (see the security = domain) 
parameter) then periodically a running  smbd(8)process will try and change the MACHINE ACCOUNT 
PASSWORD stored in the TDB called \fIprivate/secrets.tdb
\fR\&. This parameter specifies how often this password 
will be changed, in seconds. The default is one week (expressed in 
seconds), the same as a Windows NT Domain member server.

See also \fBsmbpasswd(8)
\fR, and the  security = domain) parameter.

Default: \fBmachine password timeout = 604800\fR
.TP
\fBmagic output (S)\fR
This parameter specifies the name of a file 
which will contain output created by a magic script (see the 
\fImagic script\fR
parameter below).

Warning: If two clients use the same \fImagic script
\fRin the same directory the output file content
is undefined.

Default: \fBmagic output = <magic script name>.out
\fR
Example: \fBmagic output = myfile.txt\fR
.TP
\fBmagic script (S)\fR
This parameter specifies the name of a file which, 
if opened, will be executed by the server when the file is closed. 
This allows a UNIX script to be sent to the Samba host and 
executed on behalf of the connected user.

Scripts executed in this way will be deleted upon 
completion assuming that the user has the appropriate level 
of privilege and the file permissions allow the deletion.

If the script generates output, output will be sent to 
the file specified by the \fI magic output\fR parameter (see above).

Note that some shells are unable to interpret scripts 
containing CR/LF instead of CR as 
the end-of-line marker. Magic scripts must be executable 
\fBas is\fR on the host, which for some hosts and 
some shells will require filtering at the DOS end.

Magic scripts are \fBEXPERIMENTAL\fR and 
should \fBNOT\fR be relied upon.

Default: \fBNone. Magic scripts disabled.\fR

Example: \fBmagic script = user.csh\fR
.TP
\fBmangle case (S)\fR
See the section on  NAME MANGLING

Default: \fBmangle case = no\fR
.TP
\fBmangled map (S)\fR
This is for those who want to directly map UNIX 
file names which cannot be represented on Windows/DOS. The mangling 
of names is not always what is needed. In particular you may have 
documents with file extensions that differ between DOS and UNIX. 
For example, under UNIX it is common to use \fI.html\fR 
for HTML files, whereas under Windows/DOS \fI.htm\fR 
is more commonly used.

So to map \fIhtml\fR to \fIhtm\fR 
you would use:

\fBmangled map = (*.html *.htm)\fR

One very useful case is to remove the annoying \fI;1
\fRoff the ends of filenames on some CDROMs (only visible 
under some UNIXes). To do this use a map of (*;1 *;).

Default: \fBno mangled map\fR

Example: \fBmangled map = (*;1 *;)\fR
.TP
\fBmangled names (S)\fR
This controls whether non-DOS names under UNIX 
should be mapped to DOS-compatible names ("mangled") and made visible, 
or whether non-DOS names should simply be ignored.

See the section on  NAME MANGLING for details on how to control the mangling process.

If mangling is used then the mangling algorithm is as follows:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The first (up to) five alphanumeric characters 
before the rightmost dot of the filename are preserved, forced 
to upper case, and appear as the first (up to) five characters 
of the mangled name.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
A tilde "~" is appended to the first part of the mangled
name, followed by a two-character unique sequence, based on the
original root name (i.e., the original filename minus its final
extension). The final extension is included in the hash calculation
only if it contains any upper case characters or is longer than three
characters.

Note that the character to use may be specified using 
the \fImangling char\fR
option, if you don't like '~'.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The first three alphanumeric characters of the final 
extension are preserved, forced to upper case and appear as the 
extension of the mangled name. The final extension is defined as that 
part of the original filename after the rightmost dot. If there are no 
dots in the filename, the mangled name will have no extension (except 
in the case of "hidden files" - see below).
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Files whose UNIX name begins with a dot will be 
presented as DOS hidden files. The mangled name will be created as 
for other filenames, but with the leading dot removed and "___" as

The name mangling (if enabled) allows a file to be 
copied between UNIX directories from Windows/DOS while retaining 
the long UNIX filename. UNIX files can be renamed to a new extension 
from Windows/DOS and will retain the same basename. Mangled names 
do not change between sessions.
.PP
.PP
Default: \fBmangled names = yes\fR
.PP
.TP
\fBmangled stack (G)\fR
This parameter controls the number of mangled names 
that should be cached in the Samba server  smbd(8).

This stack is a list of recently mangled base names 
(extensions are only maintained if they are longer than 3 characters 
or contains upper case characters).

The larger this value, the more likely it is that mangled 
names can be successfully converted to correct long UNIX names. 
However, large stack sizes will slow most directory accesses. Smaller 
stacks save memory in the server (each stack element costs 256 bytes).

It is not possible to absolutely guarantee correct long 
filenames, so be prepared for some surprises!

Default: \fBmangled stack = 50\fR

Example: \fBmangled stack = 100\fR
.TP
\fBmangling char (S)\fR
This controls what character is used as 
the \fBmagic\fR character in name mangling. The default is a '~'
but this may interfere with some software. Use this option to set 
it to whatever you prefer.

Default: \fBmangling char = ~\fR

Example: \fBmangling char = ^\fR
.TP
\fBmap archive (S)\fR
This controls whether the DOS archive attribute 
should be mapped to the UNIX owner execute bit. The DOS archive bit 
is set when a file has been modified since its last backup. One 
motivation for this option it to keep Samba/your PC from making 
any file it touches from becoming executable under UNIX. This can 
be quite annoying for shared source code, documents, etc...

Note that this requires the \fIcreate mask\fR
parameter to be set such that owner execute bit is not masked out 
(i.e. it must include 100). See the parameter  \fIcreate mask\fR for details.

Default: \fBmap archive = yes\fR
.TP
\fBmap hidden (S)\fR
This controls whether DOS style hidden files 
should be mapped to the UNIX world execute bit.

Note that this requires the \fIcreate mask\fR 
to be set such that the world execute bit is not masked out (i.e. 
it must include 001). See the parameter  \fIcreate mask\fR for details.

Default: \fBmap hidden = no\fR
.TP
\fBmap system (S)\fR
This controls whether DOS style system files 
should be mapped to the UNIX group execute bit.

Note that this requires the \fIcreate mask\fR 
to be set such that the group execute bit is not masked out (i.e. 
it must include 010). See the parameter  \fIcreate mask\fR for details.

Default: \fBmap system = no\fR
.TP
\fBmap to guest (G)\fR
This parameter is only useful in  security modes other than \fIsecurity = share\fR 
- i.e. user, server, 
and domain.

This parameter can take three different values, which tell
smbd(8)what to do with user 
login requests that don't match a valid UNIX user in some way.

The three settings are :
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Never - Means user login 
requests with an invalid password are rejected. This is the 
default.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Bad User - Means user
logins with an invalid password are rejected, unless the username 
does not exist, in which case it is treated as a guest login and 
mapped into the \fI guest account\fR.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Bad Password - Means user logins 
with an invalid password are treated as a guest login and mapped 
into the guest account. Note that 
this can cause problems as it means that any user incorrectly typing 
their password will be silently logged on as "guest" - and 
will not know the reason they cannot access files they think
they should - there will have been no message given to them
that they got their password wrong. Helpdesk services will
\fBhate\fR you if you set the \fImap to 
guest\fR parameter this way :-).
.RE
.PP
Note that this parameter is needed to set up "Guest" 
share services when using \fIsecurity\fR modes other than 
share. This is because in these modes the name of the resource being
requested is \fBnot\fR sent to the server until after 
the server has successfully authenticated the client so the server 
cannot make authentication decisions at the correct time (connection 
to the share) for "Guest" shares.
.PP
.PP
For people familiar with the older Samba releases, this 
parameter maps to the old compile-time setting of the  GUEST_SESSSETUP value in local.h.
.PP
.PP
Default: \fBmap to guest = Never\fR
.PP
.PP
Example: \fBmap to guest = Bad User\fR
.PP
.TP
\fBmax connections (S)\fR
This option allows the number of simultaneous 
connections to a service to be limited. If \fImax connections
\fRis greater than 0 then connections will be refused if 
this number of connections to the service are already open. A value 
of zero mean an unlimited number of connections may be made.

Record lock files are used to implement this feature. The 
lock files will be stored in the directory specified by the \fIlock directory\fR 
option.

Default: \fBmax connections = 0\fR

Example: \fBmax connections = 10\fR
.TP
\fBmax disk size (G)\fR
This option allows you to put an upper limit 
on the apparent size of disks. If you set this option to 100 
then all shares will appear to be not larger than 100 MB in 
size.

Note that this option does not limit the amount of 
data you can put on the disk. In the above case you could still 
store much more than 100 MB on the disk, but if a client ever asks 
for the amount of free disk space or the total disk size then the 
result will be bounded by the amount specified in \fImax 
disk size\fR.

This option is primarily useful to work around bugs 
in some pieces of software that can't handle very large disks, 
particularly disks over 1GB in size.

A \fImax disk size\fR of 0 means no limit.

Default: \fBmax disk size = 0\fR

Example: \fBmax disk size = 1000\fR
.TP
\fBmax log size (G)\fR
This option (an integer in kilobytes) specifies 
the max size the log file should grow to. Samba periodically checks 
the size and if it is exceeded it will rename the file, adding 
a \fI.old\fR extension.

A size of 0 means no limit.

Default: \fBmax log size = 5000\fR

Example: \fBmax log size = 1000\fR
.TP
\fBmax mux (G)\fR
This option controls the maximum number of 
outstanding simultaneous SMB operations that Samba tells the client 
it will allow. You should never need to set this parameter.

Default: \fBmax mux = 50\fR
.TP
\fBmax open files (G)\fR
This parameter limits the maximum number of 
open files that one smbd(8)file 
serving process may have open for a client at any one time. The 
default for this parameter is set very high (10,000) as Samba uses 
only one bit per unopened file.

The limit of the number of open files is usually set 
by the UNIX per-process file descriptor limit rather than 
this parameter so you should never need to touch this parameter.

Default: \fBmax open files = 10000\fR
.TP
\fBmax print jobs (S)\fR
This parameter limits the maximum number of 
jobs allowable in a Samba printer queue at any given moment.
If this number is exceeded, \fB smbd(8)\fRwill remote "Out of Space" to the client.
See all \fItotal
print jobs\fR.

Default: \fBmax print jobs = 1000\fR

Example: \fBmax print jobs = 5000\fR
.TP
\fBmax protocol (G)\fR
The value of the parameter (a string) is the highest 
protocol level that will be supported by the server.

Possible values are :
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
CORE: Earliest version. No 
concept of user names.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
COREPLUS: Slight improvements on 
CORE for efficiency.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
LANMAN1: First \fB modern\fR version of the protocol. Long filename
support.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
LANMAN2: Updates to Lanman1 protocol.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
NT1: Current up to date version of 
the protocol. Used by Windows NT. Known as CIFS.

negotiation phase in the SMB protocol takes care of choosing 
the appropriate protocol.

\fBmax smbd processes (G)\fR
This parameter limits the maximum number of 
\fBsmbd(8)\fR
processes concurrently running on a system and is intended
as a stopgap to prevent degrading service to clients in the event
that the server has insufficient resources to handle more than this
number of connections. Remember that under normal operating
conditions, each user will have an smbdassociated with him or her
to handle connections to all shares from a given host.

Default: \fBmax smbd processes = 0\fR ## no limit

Example: \fBmax smbd processes = 1000\fR
.TP
\fBmax ttl (G)\fR
This option tells nmbd(8)
what the default 'time to live' of NetBIOS names should be (in seconds) 
when \fBnmbd\fR is requesting a name using either a
broadcast packet or from a WINS server. You should never need to
change this parameter. The default is 3 days.

Default: \fBmax ttl = 259200\fR
.TP
\fBmax wins ttl (G)\fR
This option tells nmbd(8)
when acting as a WINS server ( \fIwins support = yes\fR) what the maximum
\&'time to live' of NetBIOS names that \fBnmbd\fR 
will grant will be (in seconds). You should never need to change this
parameter. The default is 6 days (518400 seconds).

See also the \fImin 
wins ttl\fR parameter.

Default: \fBmax wins ttl = 518400\fR
.TP
\fBmax xmit (G)\fR
This option controls the maximum packet size 
that will be negotiated by Samba. The default is 65535, which 
is the maximum. In some cases you may find you get better performance 
with a smaller value. A value below 2048 is likely to cause problems.

Default: \fBmax xmit = 65535\fR

Example: \fBmax xmit = 8192\fR
.TP
\fBmessage command (G)\fR
This specifies what command to run when the 
server receives a WinPopup style message.

This would normally be a command that would 
deliver the message somehow. How this is to be done is 
up to your imagination.

An example is:

\fBmessage command = csh -c 'xedit %s;rm %s' &\fR

This delivers the message using \fBxedit\fR, then 
removes it afterwards. \fBNOTE THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT THIS COMMAND RETURN IMMEDIATELY\fR. That's why I 
have the '&' on the end. If it doesn't return immediately then 
your PCs may freeze when sending messages (they should recover 
after 30 seconds, hopefully).

All messages are delivered as the global guest user. 
The command takes the standard substitutions, although \fI %u\fR won't work (\fI%U\fR may be better 
in this case).

Apart from the standard substitutions, some additional 
ones apply. In particular:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fI%s\fR = the filename containing 
the message.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fI%t\fR = the destination that 
the message was sent to (probably the server name).
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fI%f\fR = who the message 
is from.
.RE
.PP
You could make this command send mail, or whatever else 
takes your fancy. Please let us know of any really interesting 
ideas you have.

.PP
.PP
\fBmessage command = /bin/mail -s 'message from %f on

If you don't have a message command then the message 
won't be delivered and Samba will tell the sender there was 
an error. Unfortunately WfWg totally ignores the error code 
and carries on regardless, saying that the message was delivered.

.TP
\fBmin passwd length (G)\fR
Synonym for  \fImin password length\fR.
.TP
\fBmin password length (G)\fR
This option sets the minimum length in characters 
of a plaintext password that \fBsmbd\fR will accept when performing 
UNIX password changing.

See also \fIunix 
password sync\fR,  \fIpasswd program\fR and \fIpasswd chat debug\fR
\&.

Default: \fBmin password length = 5\fR
.TP
\fBmin print space (S)\fR
This sets the minimum amount of free disk 
space that must be available before a user will be able to spool 
a print job. It is specified in kilobytes. The default is 0, which 
means a user can always spool a print job.

See also the \fIprinting
\fRparameter.

Default: \fBmin print space = 0\fR

Example: \fBmin print space = 2000\fR
.TP
\fBmin protocol (G)\fR
The value of the parameter (a string) is the 
lowest SMB protocol dialect than Samba will support. Please refer
to the \fImax protocol\fR
parameter for a list of valid protocol names and a brief description
of each. You may also wish to refer to the C source code in
\fIsource/smbd/negprot.c\fR for a listing of known protocol
dialects supported by clients.

If you are viewing this parameter as a security measure, you should
also refer to the \fIlanman 
auth\fR parameter. Otherwise, you should never need 
to change this parameter.

Default : \fBmin protocol = CORE\fR

Example : \fBmin protocol = NT1\fR # disable DOS 
clients
.TP
\fBmin wins ttl (G)\fR
This option tells nmbd(8)
when acting as a WINS server (\fI wins support = yes\fR) what the minimum 'time to live' 
of NetBIOS names that \fBnmbd\fR will grant will be (in 
seconds). You should never need to change this parameter. The default 
is 6 hours (21600 seconds).

Default: \fBmin wins ttl = 21600\fR
.TP
\fBmsdfs root (S)\fR
This boolean parameter is only available if 
Samba is configured and compiled with the \fB --with-msdfs\fR option. If set to yes, 
Samba treats the share as a Dfs root and allows clients to browse 
the distributed file system tree rooted at the share directory. 
Dfs links are specified in the share directory by symbolic 
links of the form \fImsdfs:serverA\\shareA,serverB\\shareB
\fRand so on. For more information on setting up a Dfs tree 
on Samba, refer to msdfs_setup.html
.

See also \fIhost msdfs
\fR
Default: \fBmsdfs root = no\fR
.TP
\fBname resolve order (G)\fR
This option is used by the programs in the Samba 
suite to determine what naming services to use and in what order 
to resolve host names to IP addresses. The option takes a space 
separated string of name resolution options.

The options are :"lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They 
cause names to be resolved as follows :
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
lmhosts : Lookup an IP 
address in the Samba lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has 
no name type attached to the NetBIOS name (see the lmhosts(5)for details) then
any name type matches for lookup.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
host : Do a standard host 
name to IP address resolution, using the system \fI/etc/hosts
\fR, NIS, or DNS lookups. This method of name resolution 
is operating system depended for instance on IRIX or Solaris this 
may be controlled by the \fI/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR 
file. Note that this method is only used if the NetBIOS name 
type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise 
it is ignored.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
wins : Query a name with 
the IP address listed in the \fI wins server\fR parameter. If no WINS server has
been specified this method will be ignored.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
bcast : Do a broadcast on 
each of the known local interfaces listed in the \fIinterfaces\fR 
parameter. This is the least reliable of the name resolution 
methods as it depends on the target host being on a locally 
connected subnet.
.RE
.PP
Default: \fBname resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast
\fR.PP
.PP
Example: \fBname resolve order = lmhosts bcast host
\fR.PP
.PP
This will cause the local lmhosts file to be examined 
first, followed by a broadcast attempt, followed by a normal 
system hostname lookup.
.PP
.TP
\fBnetbios aliases (G)\fR
This is a list of NetBIOS names that nmbd(8)will advertise as additional 
names by which the Samba server is known. This allows one machine 
to appear in browse lists under multiple names. If a machine is 
acting as a browse server or logon server none 
of these names will be advertised as either browse server or logon 
servers, only the primary name of the machine will be advertised 
with these capabilities.

See also \fInetbios 
name\fR.

Default: \fBempty string (no additional names)\fR

Example: \fBnetbios aliases = TEST TEST1 TEST2\fR
.TP
\fBnetbios name (G)\fR
This sets the NetBIOS name by which a Samba 
server is known. By default it is the same as the first component 
of the host's DNS name. If a machine is a browse server or
logon server this name (or the first component
of the hosts DNS name) will be the name that these services are
advertised under.

See also \fInetbios 
aliases\fR.

Default: \fBmachine DNS name\fR

Example: \fBnetbios name = MYNAME\fR
.TP
\fBnetbios scope (G)\fR
This sets the NetBIOS scope that Samba will 
operate under. This should not be set unless every machine 
on your LAN also sets this value.
.TP
\fBnis homedir (G)\fR
Get the home share server from a NIS map. For 
UNIX systems that use an automounter, the user's home directory 
will often be mounted on a workstation on demand from a remote 
server. 

When the Samba logon server is not the actual home directory 
server, but is mounting the home directories via NFS then two 
network hops would be required to access the users home directory 
if the logon server told the client to use itself as the SMB server 
for home directories (one over SMB and one over NFS). This can 
be very slow.

This option allows Samba to return the home share as 
being on a different server to the logon server and as 
long as a Samba daemon is running on the home directory server, 
it will be mounted on the Samba client directly from the directory 
server. When Samba is returning the home share to the client, it 
will consult the NIS map specified in  \fIhomedir map\fR and return the server 
listed there.

Note that for this option to work there must be a working 
NIS system and the Samba server with this option must also 
be a logon server.

Default: \fBnis homedir = no\fR
.TP
\fBnt acl support (S)\fR
This boolean parameter controls whether 
smbd(8)will attempt to map 
UNIX permissions into Windows NT access control lists.
This parameter was formally a global parameter in releases
prior to 2.2.2.

Default: \fBnt acl support = yes\fR
.TP
\fBnt pipe support (G)\fR
This boolean parameter controls whether 
smbd(8)will allow Windows NT 
clients to connect to the NT SMB specific IPC$ 
pipes. This is a developer debugging option and can be left
alone.

Default: \fBnt pipe support = yes\fR
.TP
\fBnt smb support (G)\fR
This boolean parameter controls whether smbd(8)will negotiate NT specific SMB
support with Windows NT/2k/XP clients. Although this is a developer
debugging option and should be left alone, benchmarking has discovered
that Windows NT clients give faster performance with this option
set to no. This is still being investigated.
If this option is set to no then Samba offers
exactly the same SMB calls that versions prior to Samba 2.0 offered.
This information may be of use if any users are having problems
with NT SMB support.

You should not need to ever disable this parameter.

Default: \fBnt smb support = yes\fR
.TP
\fBnt status support (G)\fR
This boolean parameter controls whether smbd(8)will negotiate NT specific status
support with Windows NT/2k/XP clients. This is a developer
debugging option and should be left alone.
If this option is set to no then Samba offers
exactly the same DOS error codes that versions prior to Samba 2.2.3
reported.

You should not need to ever disable this parameter.

Default: \fBnt status support = yes\fR
.TP
\fBnull passwords (G)\fR
Allow or disallow client access to accounts 
that have null passwords. 

See also smbpasswd (5).

Default: \fBnull passwords = no\fR
.TP
\fBobey pam restrictions (G)\fR
When Samba 2.2 is configured to enable PAM support
(i.e. --with-pam), this parameter will control whether or not Samba
should obey PAM's account and session management directives. The 
default behavior is to use PAM for clear text authentication only
and to ignore any account or session management. Note that Samba
always ignores PAM for authentication in the case of \fIencrypt passwords = yes\fR
\&. The reason is that PAM modules cannot support the challenge/response
authentication mechanism needed in the presence of SMB password encryption.

Default: \fBobey pam restrictions = no\fR
.TP
\fBonly user (S)\fR
This is a boolean option that controls whether 
connections with usernames not in the \fIuser\fR 
list will be allowed. By default this option is disabled so that a 
client can supply a username to be used by the server. Enabling
this parameter will force the server to only user the login 
names from the \fIuser\fR list and is only really
useful in shave level
security.

Note that this also means Samba won't try to deduce 
usernames from the service name. This can be annoying for 
the [homes] section. To get around this you could use \fBuser =
%S\fR which means your \fIuser\fR list
will be just the service name, which for home directories is the 
name of the user.

See also the \fIuser\fR
parameter.

Default: \fBonly user = no\fR
.TP
\fBonly guest (S)\fR
A synonym for \fI guest only\fR.
.TP
\fBoplock break wait time (G)\fR
This is a tuning parameter added due to bugs in 
both Windows 9x and WinNT. If Samba responds to a client too 
quickly when that client issues an SMB that can cause an oplock 
break request, then the network client can fail and not respond 
to the break request. This tuning parameter (which is set in milliseconds) 
is the amount of time Samba will wait before sending an oplock break 
request to such (broken) clients.

\fBDO NOT CHANGE THIS PARAMETER UNLESS YOU HAVE READ 
AND UNDERSTOOD THE SAMBA OPLOCK CODE\fR.

Default: \fBoplock break wait time = 0\fR
.TP
\fBoplock contention limit (S)\fR
This is a \fBvery\fR advanced 
smbd(8)tuning option to 
improve the efficiency of the granting of oplocks under multiple 
client contention for the same file.

In brief it specifies a number, which causes smbdnot to 
grant an oplock even when requested if the approximate number of 
clients contending for an oplock on the same file goes over this 
limit. This causes \fBsmbd\fR to behave in a similar 
way to Windows NT.

\fBDO NOT CHANGE THIS PARAMETER UNLESS YOU HAVE READ 
AND UNDERSTOOD THE SAMBA OPLOCK CODE\fR.

Default: \fBoplock contention limit = 2\fR
.TP
\fBoplocks (S)\fR
This boolean option tells \fBsmbd\fR whether to 
issue oplocks (opportunistic locks) to file open requests on this 
share. The oplock code can dramatically (approx. 30% or more) improve 
the speed of access to files on Samba servers. It allows the clients 
to aggressively cache files locally and you may want to disable this 
option for unreliable network environments (it is turned on by 
default in Windows NT Servers). For more information see the file 
\fISpeed.txt\fR in the Samba \fIdocs/\fR 
directory.

Oplocks may be selectively turned off on certain files with a 
share. See the \fI veto oplock files\fR parameter. On some systems 
oplocks are recognized by the underlying operating system. This 
allows data synchronization between all access to oplocked files, 
whether it be via Samba or NFS or a local UNIX process. See the 
\fIkernel oplocks\fR parameter for details.

See also the \fIkernel 
oplocks\fR and \fI level2 oplocks\fR parameters.

Default: \fBoplocks = yes\fR
.TP
\fBos level (G)\fR
This integer value controls what level Samba 
advertises itself as for browse elections. The value of this 
parameter determines whether nmbd(8)
has a chance of becoming a local master browser for the \fI WORKGROUP\fR in the local broadcast area.

\fBNote :\fRBy default, Samba will win 
a local master browsing election over all Microsoft operating 
systems except a Windows NT 4.0/2000 Domain Controller. This 
means that a misconfigured Samba host can effectively isolate 
a subnet for browsing purposes. See \fIBROWSING.txt
\fRin the Samba \fIdocs/\fR directory 
for details.

Default: \fBos level = 20\fR

Example: \fBos level = 65 \fR
.TP
\fBos2 driver map (G)\fR
The parameter is used to define the absolute
path to a file containing a mapping of Windows NT printer driver
names to OS/2 printer driver names. The format is:

<nt driver name> = <os2 driver 
name>.<device name>

For example, a valid entry using the HP LaserJet 5
printer driver would appear as \fBHP LaserJet 5L = LASERJET.HP 
LaserJet 5L\fR.

The need for the file is due to the printer driver namespace 
problem described in the Samba 
Printing HOWTO. For more details on OS/2 clients, please 
refer to the OS2-Client-HOWTO
containing in the Samba documentation.

Default: \fBos2 driver map = <empty string>
\fR.TP
\fBpam password change (G)\fR
With the addition of better PAM support in Samba 2.2, 
this parameter, it is possible to use PAM's password change control 
flag for Samba. If enabled, then PAM will be used for password
changes when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in 
\fIpasswd program\fR. 
It should be possible to enable this without changing your 
\fIpasswd chat\fR
parameter for most setups.

Default: \fBpam password change = no\fR
.TP
\fBpanic action (G)\fR
This is a Samba developer option that allows a 
system command to be called when either  smbd(8)
crashes. This is usually used to draw attention to the fact that 
a problem occurred.

Default: \fBpanic action = <empty string>\fR

Example: \fBpanic action = "/bin/sleep 90000"\fR
.TP
\fBpasswd chat (G)\fR
This string controls the \fB"chat"\fR 
conversation that takes places between smbdand the local password changing
program to change the user's password. The string describes a 
sequence of response-receive pairs that  smbd(8)uses to determine what to send to the 
\fIpasswd program\fR
and what to expect back. If the expected output is not 
received then the password is not changed.

This chat sequence is often quite site specific, depending 
on what local methods are used for password control (such as NIS 
etc).

Note that this parameter only is only used if the \fIunix 
password sync\fR parameter is set to yes. This 
sequence is then called \fBAS ROOT\fR when the SMB password 
in the smbpasswd file is being changed, without access to the old 
password cleartext. This means that root must be able to reset the user's password
without knowing the text of the previous password. In the presence of NIS/YP, 
this means that the passwd program must be 
executed on the NIS master.

The string can contain the macro \fI%n\fR which is substituted 
for the new password. The chat sequence can also contain the standard 
macros \\n, \\r,  \\t and \\s to give line-feed, 
carriage-return, tab and space. The chat sequence string can also contain 
a '*' which matches any sequence of characters.
Double quotes can be used to collect strings with spaces 
in them into a single string.

If the send string in any part of the chat sequence 
is a full stop ".", then no string is sent. Similarly, 
if the expect string is a full stop then no string is expected.

If the \fIpam
password change\fR parameter is set to true, the chat pairs
may be matched in any order, and success is determined by the PAM result, 
not any particular output. The \\n macro is ignored for PAM conversions.

See also \fIunix password 
sync\fR, \fI passwd program\fR , \fIpasswd chat debug\fR and  \fIpam password change\fR.

Default: \fBpasswd chat = *new*password* %n\\n 
*new*password* %n\\n *changed*\fR

Example: \fBpasswd chat = "*Enter OLD password*" %o\\n 
"*Enter NEW password*" %n\\n "*Reenter NEW password*" %n\\n "*Password 
changed*"\fR
.TP
\fBpasswd chat debug (G)\fR
This boolean specifies if the passwd chat script 
parameter is run in \fBdebug\fR mode. In this mode the 
strings passed to and received from the passwd chat are printed 
in the smbd(8)log with a 
\fIdebug level\fR 
of 100. This is a dangerous option as it will allow plaintext passwords 
to be seen in the \fBsmbd\fR log. It is available to help 
Samba admins debug their \fIpasswd chat\fR scripts 
when calling the \fIpasswd program\fR and should 
be turned off after this has been done. This option has no effect if the 
\fIpam password change\fR
paramter is set. This parameter is off by default.

See also \fIpasswd chat\fR
, \fIpam password change\fR
, \fIpasswd program\fR
\&.

Default: \fBpasswd chat debug = no\fR
.TP
\fBpasswd program (G)\fR
The name of a program that can be used to set 
UNIX user passwords. Any occurrences of \fI%u\fR 
will be replaced with the user name. The user name is checked for 
existence before calling the password changing program.

Also note that many passwd programs insist in \fBreasonable
\fRpasswords, such as a minimum length, or the inclusion 
of mixed case chars and digits. This can pose a problem as some clients 
(such as Windows for Workgroups) uppercase the password before sending 
it.

\fBNote\fR that if the \fIunix 
password sync\fR parameter is set to true
then this program is called \fBAS ROOT\fR 
before the SMB password in the smbpasswd(5)
file is changed. If this UNIX password change fails, then 
\fBsmbd\fR will fail to change the SMB password also 
(this is by design).

If the \fIunix password sync\fR parameter 
is set this parameter \fBMUST USE ABSOLUTE PATHS\fR 
for \fBALL\fR programs called, and must be examined 
for security implications. Note that by default \fIunix 
password sync\fR is set to false.

See also \fIunix 
password sync\fR.

Default: \fBpasswd program = /bin/passwd\fR

Example: \fBpasswd program = /sbin/npasswd %u\fR
.TP
\fBpassword level (G)\fR
Some client/server combinations have difficulty 
with mixed-case passwords. One offending client is Windows for 
Workgroups, which for some reason forces passwords to upper 
case when using the LANMAN1 protocol, but leaves them alone when 
using COREPLUS! Another problem child is the Windows 95/98
family of operating systems. These clients upper case clear
text passwords even when NT LM 0.12 selected by the protocol
negotiation request/response.

This parameter defines the maximum number of characters 
that may be upper case in passwords.

For example, say the password given was "FRED". If \fI password level\fR is set to 1, the following combinations 
would be tried if "FRED" failed:

"Fred", "fred", "fRed", "frEd","freD"

If \fIpassword level\fR was set to 2, 
the following combinations would also be tried: 

"FRed", "FrEd", "FreD", "fREd", "fReD", "frED", ..

And so on.

The higher value this parameter is set to the more likely 
it is that a mixed case password will be matched against a single 
case password. However, you should be aware that use of this 
parameter reduces security and increases the time taken to 
process a new connection.

A value of zero will cause only two attempts to be 
made - the password as is and the password in all-lower case.

Default: \fBpassword level = 0\fR

Example: \fBpassword level = 4\fR
.TP
\fBpassword server (G)\fR
By specifying the name of another SMB server (such 
as a WinNT box) with this option, and using \fBsecurity = domain
\fRor \fBsecurity = server\fR you can get Samba 
to do all its username/password validation via a remote server.

This option sets the name of the password server to use. 
It must be a NetBIOS name, so if the machine's NetBIOS name is 
different from its Internet name then you may have to add its NetBIOS 
name to the lmhosts file which is stored in the same directory 
as the \fIsmb.conf\fR file.

The name of the password server is looked up using the 
parameter \fIname 
resolve order\fR and so may resolved
by any method and order described in that parameter.

The password server much be a machine capable of using 
the "LM1.2X002" or the "NT LM 0.12" protocol, and it must be in 
user level security mode.

\fBNOTE:\fR Using a password server 
means your UNIX box (running Samba) is only as secure as your 
password server. \fBDO NOT CHOOSE A PASSWORD SERVER THAT 
YOU DON'T COMPLETELY TRUST\fR.

Never point a Samba server at itself for password 
serving. This will cause a loop and could lock up your Samba 
server!

The name of the password server takes the standard 
substitutions, but probably the only useful one is \fI%m
\fR, which means the Samba server will use the incoming 
client as the password server. If you use this then you better 
trust your clients, and you had better restrict them with hosts allow!

If the \fIsecurity\fR parameter is set to
domain, then the list of machines in this 
option must be a list of Primary or Backup Domain controllers for the
Domain or the character '*', as the Samba server is effectively
in that domain, and will use cryptographically authenticated RPC calls
to authenticate the user logging on. The advantage of using \fB security = domain\fR is that if you list several hosts in the 
\fIpassword server\fR option then \fBsmbd
\fRwill try each in turn till it finds one that responds. This 
is useful in case your primary server goes down.

If the \fIpassword server\fR option is set 
to the character '*', then Samba will attempt to auto-locate the 
Primary or Backup Domain controllers to authenticate against by 
doing a query for the name WORKGROUP<1C> 
and then contacting each server returned in the list of IP 
addresses from the name resolution source. 

If the \fIsecurity\fR parameter is 
set to server, then there are different
restrictions that \fBsecurity = domain\fR doesn't 
suffer from:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
You may list several password servers in 
the \fIpassword server\fR parameter, however if an 
\fBsmbd\fR makes a connection to a password server, 
and then the password server fails, no more users will be able 
to be authenticated from this \fBsmbd\fR. This is a 
restriction of the SMB/CIFS protocol when in \fBsecurity = server
\fRmode and cannot be fixed in Samba.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If you are using a Windows NT server as your 
password server then you will have to ensure that your users 
are able to login from the Samba server, as when in \fB security = server\fR mode the network logon will appear to 
come from there rather than from the users workstation.

.TP
\fBpath (S)\fR
This parameter specifies a directory to which 
the user of the service is to be given access. In the case of 
printable services, this is where print data will spool prior to 
being submitted to the host for printing.

For a printable service offering guest access, the service 
should be readonly and the path should be world-writeable and 
have the sticky bit set. This is not mandatory of course, but 
you probably won't get the results you expect if you do 
otherwise.

Any occurrences of \fI%u\fR in the path 
will be replaced with the UNIX username that the client is using 
on this connection. Any occurrences of \fI%m\fR 
will be replaced by the NetBIOS name of the machine they are 
connecting from. These replacements are very useful for setting 
up pseudo home directories for users.

Note that this path will be based on  \fIroot dir\fR if one was specified.

Default: \fBnone\fR

Example: \fBpath = /home/fred\fR
.TP
\fBpid directory (G)\fR
This option specifies the directory where pid 
files will be placed. 

Default: \fBpid directory = ${prefix}/var/locks\fR

Example: \fBpid directory = /var/run/\fR
.TP
\fBposix locking (S)\fR
The \fBsmbd(8)\fR
daemon maintains an database of file locks obtained by SMB clients.
The default behavior is to map this internal database to POSIX
locks. This means that file locks obtained by SMB clients are 
consistent with those seen by POSIX compliant applications accessing 
the files via a non-SMB method (e.g. NFS or local file access). 
You should never need to disable this parameter.

Default: \fBposix locking = yes\fR
.TP
\fBpostexec (S)\fR
This option specifies a command to be run 
whenever the service is disconnected. It takes the usual 
substitutions. The command may be run as the root on some 
systems.

An interesting example may be to unmount server 
resources:

\fBpostexec = /etc/umount /cdrom\fR

See also \fIpreexec\fR
\&.

Default: \fBnone (no command executed)\fR

Example: \fBpostexec = echo \\"%u disconnected from %S 
from %m (%I)\\" >> /tmp/log\fR
.TP
\fBpostscript (S)\fR
This parameter forces a printer to interpret 
the print files as PostScript. This is done by adding a %!
to the start of print output.

This is most useful when you have lots of PCs that persist 
in putting a control-D at the start of print jobs, which then 
confuses your printer.

Default: \fBpostscript = no\fR
.TP
\fBpreexec (S)\fR
This option specifies a command to be run whenever 
the service is connected to. It takes the usual substitutions.

An interesting example is to send the users a welcome 
message every time they log in. Maybe a message of the day? Here 
is an example:

\fBpreexec = csh -c 'echo \\"Welcome to %S!\\" |
/usr/local/samba/bin/smbclient -M %m -I %I' & \fR

Of course, this could get annoying after a while :-)

See also \fIpreexec close
\fRand \fIpostexec
\fR\&.

Default: \fBnone (no command executed)\fR

Example: \fBpreexec = echo \\"%u connected to %S from %m
(%I)\\" >> /tmp/log\fR
.TP
\fBpreexec close (S)\fR
This boolean option controls whether a non-zero 
return code from \fIpreexec
\fRshould close the service being connected to.

Default: \fBpreexec close = no\fR
.TP
\fBpreferred master (G)\fR
This boolean parameter controls if nmbd(8)is a preferred master browser 
for its workgroup.

If this is set to true, on startup, \fBnmbd\fR 
will force an election, and it will have a slight advantage in 
winning the election. It is recommended that this parameter is 
used in conjunction with \fB\fI domain master\fB = yes\fR, so that \fB nmbd\fR can guarantee becoming a domain master.

Use this option with caution, because if there are several 
hosts (whether Samba servers, Windows 95 or NT) that are preferred 
master browsers on the same subnet, they will each periodically 
and continuously attempt to become the local master browser. 
This will result in unnecessary broadcast traffic and reduced browsing
capabilities.

See also \fIos level\fR
\&.

Default: \fBpreferred master = auto\fR
.TP
\fBprefered master (G)\fR
Synonym for \fI preferred master\fR for people who cannot spell :-).
.TP
\fBpreload\fR
This is a list of services that you want to be 
automatically added to the browse lists. This is most useful 
for homes and printers services that would otherwise not be 
visible.

Note that if you just want all printers in your 
printcap file loaded then the  \fIload printers\fR option is easier.

Default: \fBno preloaded services\fR

Example: \fBpreload = fred lp colorlp\fR
.TP
\fBpreserve case (S)\fR
This controls if new filenames are created
with the case that the client passes, or if they are forced to 
be the \fIdefault case
\fR\&.

Default: \fBpreserve case = yes\fR

See the section on NAME 
MANGLING for a fuller discussion.
.TP
\fBprint command (S)\fR
After a print job has finished spooling to 
a service, this command will be used via a \fBsystem()\fR 
call to process the spool file. Typically the command specified will 
submit the spool file to the host's printing subsystem, but there 
is no requirement that this be the case. The server will not remove 
the spool file, so whatever command you specify should remove the 
spool file when it has been processed, otherwise you will need to 
manually remove old spool files.

The print command is simply a text string. It will be used 
verbatim, with two exceptions: All occurrences of \fI%s
\fRand \fI%f\fR will be replaced by the 
appropriate spool file name, and all occurrences of \fI%p
\fRwill be replaced by the appropriate printer name. The 
spool file name is generated automatically by the server. The 
\fI%J\fR macro can be used to access the job 
name as transmitted by the client.

The print command \fBMUST\fR contain at least 
one occurrence of \fI%s\fR or \fI%f
\fR- the \fI%p\fR is optional. At the time 
a job is submitted, if no printer name is supplied the \fI%p
\fRwill be silently removed from the printer command.

If specified in the [global] section, the print command given 
will be used for any printable service that does not have its own 
print command specified.

If there is neither a specified print command for a 
printable service nor a global print command, spool files will 
be created but not processed and (most importantly) not removed.

Note that printing may fail on some UNIXes from the 
nobody account. If this happens then create 
an alternative guest account that can print and set the \fIguest account\fR 
in the [global] section.

You can form quite complex print commands by realizing 
that they are just passed to a shell. For example the following 
will log a print job, print the file, then remove it. Note that 
\&';' is the usual separator for command in shell scripts.

\fBprint command = echo Printing %s >> 
/tmp/print.log; lpr -P %p %s; rm %s\fR

You may have to vary this command considerably depending 
on how you normally print files on your system. The default for 
the parameter varies depending on the setting of the  \fIprinting\fR parameter.

Default: For \fBprinting = BSD, AIX, QNX, LPRNG 
or PLP :\fR

\fBprint command = lpr -r -P%p %s\fR

For \fBprinting = SYSV or HPUX :\fR

\fBprint command = lp -c -d%p %s; rm %s\fR

For \fBprinting = SOFTQ :\fR

\fBprint command = lp -d%p -s %s; rm %s\fR

Example: \fBprint command = /usr/local/samba/bin/myprintscript
%p %s\fR
.TP
\fBprint ok (S)\fR
Synonym for  \fIprintable\fR.
.TP
\fBprintable (S)\fR
If this parameter is yes, then 
clients may open, write to and submit spool files on the directory 
specified for the service. 

Note that a printable service will ALWAYS allow writing 
to the service path (user privileges permitting) via the spooling 
of print data. The \fIwriteable
\fRparameter controls only non-printing access to 
the resource.

Default: \fBprintable = no\fR
.TP
\fBprintcap (G)\fR
Synonym for \fI printcap name\fR.
.TP
\fBprintcap name (G)\fR
This parameter may be used to override the 
compiled-in default printcap name used by the server (usually \fI /etc/printcap\fR). See the discussion of the [printers] section above for reasons 
why you might want to do this.

To use the CUPS printing interface set \fBprintcap name = cups
\fR\&.

On System V systems that use \fBlpstat\fR to 
list available printers you can use \fBprintcap name = lpstat
\fRto automatically obtain lists of available printers. This 
is the default for systems that define SYSV at configure time in 
Samba (this includes most System V based systems). If \fI printcap name\fR is set to \fBlpstat\fR on 
these systems then Samba will launch \fBlpstat -v\fR and 
attempt to parse the output to obtain a printer list.

A minimal printcap file would look something like this:

.sp
.nf
		print1|My Printer 1
		print2|My Printer 2
		print3|My Printer 3
		print4|My Printer 4
		print5|My Printer 5
		
.sp
.fi

where the '|' separates aliases of a printer. The fact 
that the second alias has a space in it gives a hint to Samba 
that it's a comment.

\fBNOTE\fR: Under AIX the default printcap 
name is \fI/etc/qconfig\fR. Samba will assume the 
file is in AIX \fIqconfig\fR format if the string
\fIqconfig\fR appears in the printcap filename.

Default: \fBprintcap name = /etc/printcap\fR

Example: \fBprintcap name = /etc/myprintcap\fR
.TP
\fBprinter admin (S)\fR
This is a list of users that can do anything to 
printers via the remote administration interfaces offered by MS-RPC 
(usually using a NT workstation). Note that the root user always 
has admin rights.

Default: \fBprinter admin = <empty string>\fR

Example: \fBprinter admin = admin, @staff\fR
.TP
\fBprinter driver (S)\fR
\fBNote :\fRThis is a deprecated 
parameter and will be removed in the next major release
following version 2.2. Please see the instructions in
the Samba 2.2. Printing
HOWTOfor more information
on the new method of loading printer drivers onto a Samba server.

This option allows you to control the string 
that clients receive when they ask the server for the printer driver 
associated with a printer. If you are using Windows95 or Windows NT 
then you can use this to automate the setup of printers on your 
system.

You need to set this parameter to the exact string (case 
sensitive) that describes the appropriate printer driver for your 
system. If you don't know the exact string to use then you should 
first try with no \fI printer driver\fR option set and the client will 
give you a list of printer drivers. The appropriate strings are 
shown in a scroll box after you have chosen the printer manufacturer.

See also \fIprinter
driver file\fR.

Example: \fBprinter driver = HP LaserJet 4L\fR

parameter and will be removed in the next major release
following version 2.2. Please see the instructions in

HOWTOfor more information
on the new method of loading printer drivers onto a Samba server.

This parameter tells Samba where the printer driver 
definition file, used when serving drivers to Windows 95 clients, is 
to be found. If this is not set, the default is :

\fISAMBA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY
/lib/printers.def\fR

This file is created from Windows 95 \fImsprint.inf
\fRfiles found on the Windows 95 client system. For more 
details on setting up serving of printer drivers to Windows 95 
clients, see the outdated documentation file in the \fIdocs/\fR 
directory, \fIPRINTER_DRIVER.txt\fR.

See also \fI printer driver location\fR.

This parameter tells clients of a particular printer 
share where to find the printer driver files for the automatic 
installation of drivers for Windows 95 machines. If Samba is set up 
to serve printer drivers to Windows 95 machines, this should be set to

\fB\\\\MACHINE\\PRINTER$\fR

Where MACHINE is the NetBIOS name of your Samba server, 
and PRINTER$ is a share you set up for serving printer driver 
files. For more details on setting this up see the outdated documentation 
file in the \fIdocs/\fR directory, \fI PRINTER_DRIVER.txt\fR.

\fBprinter name (S)\fR
This parameter specifies the name of the printer 
to which print jobs spooled through a printable service will be sent.

If specified in the [global] section, the printer

not have its own printer name specified.

Default: \fBnone (but may be lp

\fBqueuepause command (S)\fR
This parameter specifies the command to be 
executed on the server host in order to pause the printer queue.

This command should be a program or script which takes 
a printer name as its only parameter and stops the printer queue, 
such that no longer jobs are submitted to the printer.

This command is not supported by Windows for Workgroups, 
but can be issued from the Printers window under Windows 95 
and NT.

If a \fI%p\fR is given then the printer name 
is put in its place. Otherwise it is placed at the end of the command.

Note that it is good practice to include the absolute 
path in the command as the PATH may not be available to the 
server.

Default: \fBdepends on the setting of \fIprinting
\fB\fR
Example: \fBqueuepause command = disable %p\fR
.TP
\fBqueueresume command (S)\fR
This parameter specifies the command to be 
executed on the server host in order to resume the printer queue. It 
is the command to undo the behavior that is caused by the 
previous parameter (\fI queuepause command\fR).

This command should be a program or script which takes 
a printer name as its only parameter and resumes the printer queue, 
such that queued jobs are resubmitted to the printer.

This command is not supported by Windows for Workgroups, 
but can be issued from the Printers window under Windows 95 
and NT.

If a \fI%p\fR is given then the printer name 
is put in its place. Otherwise it is placed at the end of the 
command.

Note that it is good practice to include the absolute 
path in the command as the PATH may not be available to the 
server.

Default: \fBdepends on the setting of \fIprinting\fB\fR

Example: \fBqueuepause command = enable %p
\fR.TP
\fBread bmpx (G)\fR
This boolean parameter controls whether smbd(8)will support the "Read 
Block Multiplex" SMB. This is now rarely used and defaults to 
no. You should never need to set this 
parameter.

Default: \fBread bmpx = no\fR
.TP
\fBread list (S)\fR
This is a list of users that are given read-only 
access to a service. If the connecting user is in this list then 
they will not be given write access, no matter what the \fIwriteable\fR
option is set to. The list can include group names using the 
syntax described in the \fI invalid users\fR parameter.

See also the \fI write list\fR parameter and the \fIinvalid users\fR
parameter.

Default: \fBread list = <empty string>\fR

Example: \fBread list = mary, @students\fR
.TP
\fBread only (S)\fR
Note that this is an inverted synonym for \fIwriteable\fR.
.TP
\fBread raw (G)\fR
This parameter controls whether or not the server 
will support the raw read SMB requests when transferring data 
to clients.

If enabled, raw reads allow reads of 65535 bytes in 
one packet. This typically provides a major performance benefit.

However, some clients either negotiate the allowable 
block size incorrectly or are incapable of supporting larger block 
sizes, and for these clients you may need to disable raw reads.

In general this parameter should be viewed as a system tuning 
tool and left severely alone. See also  \fIwrite raw\fR.

Default: \fBread raw = yes\fR
.TP
\fBread size (G)\fR
The option \fIread size\fR 
affects the overlap of disk reads/writes with network reads/writes. 
If the amount of data being transferred in several of the SMB 
commands (currently SMBwrite, SMBwriteX and SMBreadbraw) is larger 
than this value then the server begins writing the data before it 
has received the whole packet from the network, or in the case of 
SMBreadbraw, it begins writing to the network before all the data 
has been read from disk.

This overlapping works best when the speeds of disk and 
network access are similar, having very little effect when the 
speed of one is much greater than the other.

The default value is 16384, but very little experimentation 
has been done yet to determine the optimal value, and it is likely 
that the best value will vary greatly between systems anyway. 
A value over 65536 is pointless and will cause you to allocate 
memory unnecessarily.

Default: \fBread size = 16384\fR

Example: \fBread size = 8192\fR
.TP
\fBremote announce (G)\fR
This option allows you to setup nmbd(8)to periodically announce itself 
to arbitrary IP addresses with an arbitrary workgroup name.

This is useful if you want your Samba server to appear 
in a remote workgroup for which the normal browse propagation 
rules don't work. The remote workgroup can be anywhere that you 
can send IP packets to.

For example:

\fBremote announce = 192.168.2.255/SERVERS 
192.168.4.255/STAFF\fR

the above line would cause \fBnmbd\fR to announce itself 
to the two given IP addresses using the given workgroup names. 
If you leave out the workgroup name then the one given in 
the \fIworkgroup\fR 
parameter is used instead.

The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast 
addresses of the remote networks, but can also be the IP addresses 
of known browse masters if your network config is that stable.

See the documentation file \fIBROWSING.txt\fR 
in the \fIdocs/\fR directory.

Default: \fBremote announce = <empty string>
\fR.TP
\fBremote browse sync (G)\fR
This option allows you to setup nmbd(8)to periodically request 
synchronization of browse lists with the master browser of a Samba 
server that is on a remote segment. This option will allow you to 
gain browse lists for multiple workgroups across routed networks. This 
is done in a manner that does not work with any non-Samba servers.

This is useful if you want your Samba server and all local 
clients to appear in a remote workgroup for which the normal browse 
propagation rules don't work. The remote workgroup can be anywhere 
that you can send IP packets to.

For example:

\fBremote browse sync = 192.168.2.255 192.168.4.255
\fR
the above line would cause \fBnmbd\fR to request 
the master browser on the specified subnets or addresses to 
synchronize their browse lists with the local server.

The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast 
addresses of the remote networks, but can also be the IP addresses 
of known browse masters if your network config is that stable. If 
a machine IP address is given Samba makes NO attempt to validate 
that the remote machine is available, is listening, nor that it 
is in fact the browse master on its segment.

Default: \fBremote browse sync = <empty string>
\fR.TP
\fBrestrict anonymous (G)\fR
This is a boolean parameter. If it is true, then 
anonymous access to the server will be restricted, namely in the 
case where the server is expecting the client to send a username, 
but it doesn't. Setting it to true will force these anonymous 
connections to be denied, and the client will be required to always 
supply a username and password when connecting. Use of this parameter 
is only recommended for homogeneous NT client environments.

This parameter makes the use of macro expansions that rely
on the username (%U, %G, etc) consistent. NT 4.0 
likes to use anonymous connections when refreshing the share list, 
and this is a way to work around that.

When restrict anonymous is true, all anonymous connections 
are denied no matter what they are for. This can effect the ability 
of a machine to access the Samba Primary Domain Controller to revalidate 
its machine account after someone else has logged on the client 
interactively. The NT client will display a message saying that 
the machine's account in the domain doesn't exist or the password is 
bad. The best way to deal with this is to reboot NT client machines 
between interactive logons, using "Shutdown and Restart", rather 
than "Close all programs and logon as a different user".

Default: \fBrestrict anonymous = no\fR
.TP
\fBroot (G)\fR
Synonym for  \fIroot directory"\fR.
.TP
\fBroot dir (G)\fR
Synonym for  \fIroot directory"\fR.
.TP
\fBroot directory (G)\fR
The server will \fBchroot()\fR (i.e. 
Change its root directory) to this directory on startup. This is 
not strictly necessary for secure operation. Even without it the 
server will deny access to files not in one of the service entries. 
It may also check for, and deny access to, soft links to other 
parts of the filesystem, or attempts to use ".." in file names 
to access other directories (depending on the setting of the \fIwide links\fR 
parameter).

Adding a \fIroot directory\fR entry other 
than "/" adds an extra level of security, but at a price. It 
absolutely ensures that no access is given to files not in the 
sub-tree specified in the \fIroot directory\fR 
option, \fBincluding\fR some files needed for 
complete operation of the server. To maintain full operability 
of the server you will need to mirror some system files 
into the \fIroot directory\fR tree. In particular 
you will need to mirror \fI/etc/passwd\fR (or a 
subset of it), and any binaries or configuration files needed for 
printing (if required). The set of files that must be mirrored is
operating system dependent.

Default: \fBroot directory = /\fR

Example: \fBroot directory = /homes/smb\fR
.TP
\fBroot postexec (S)\fR
This is the same as the \fIpostexec\fR
parameter except that the command is run as root. This 
is useful for unmounting filesystems 
(such as CDROMs) after a connection is closed.

See also \fI postexec\fR.

Default: \fBroot postexec = <empty string>
\fR.TP
\fBroot preexec (S)\fR
This is the same as the \fIpreexec\fR
parameter except that the command is run as root. This 
is useful for mounting filesystems (such as CDROMs) when a 
connection is opened.

See also \fI preexec\fR and  \fIpreexec close\fR.

Default: \fBroot preexec = <empty string>
\fR.TP
\fBroot preexec close (S)\fR
This is the same as the \fIpreexec close
\fRparameter except that the command is run as root.

See also \fI preexec\fR and  \fIpreexec close\fR.

Default: \fBroot preexec close = no\fR
.TP
\fBsecurity (G)\fR
This option affects how clients respond to 
Samba and is one of the most important settings in the \fI smb.conf\fR file.

The option sets the "security mode bit" in replies to 
protocol negotiations with smbd(8)
to turn share level security on or off. Clients decide 
based on this bit whether (and how) to transfer user and password 
information to the server.

The default is \fBsecurity = user\fR, as this is
the most common setting needed when talking to Windows 98 and 
Windows NT.

The alternatives are \fBsecurity = share\fR,
\fBsecurity = server\fR or \fBsecurity = domain
\fR\&.

In versions of Samba prior to 2.0.0, the default was 
\fBsecurity = share\fR mainly because that was
the only option at one stage.

There is a bug in WfWg that has relevance to this 
setting. When in user or server level security a WfWg client 
will totally ignore the password you type in the "connect 
drive" dialog box. This makes it very difficult (if not impossible) 
to connect to a Samba service as anyone except the user that 
you are logged into WfWg as.

If your PCs use usernames that are the same as their 
usernames on the UNIX machine then you will want to use 
\fBsecurity = user\fR. If you mostly use usernames 
that don't exist on the UNIX box then use \fBsecurity = 
share\fR.

You should also use \fBsecurity = share\fR if you 
want to mainly setup shares without a password (guest shares). This 
is commonly used for a shared printer server. It is more difficult 
to setup guest shares with \fBsecurity = user\fR, see 
the \fImap to guest\fR
parameter for details.

It is possible to use \fBsmbd\fR in a \fB hybrid mode\fR where it is offers both user and share 
level security under different  \fINetBIOS aliases\fR. 

The different settings will now be explained.

\fBSECURITY = SHARE
\fR
When clients connect to a share level security server they 
need not log onto the server with a valid username and password before 
attempting to connect to a shared resource (although modern clients 
such as Windows 95/98 and Windows NT will send a logon request with 
a username but no password when talking to a \fBsecurity = share
\fRserver). Instead, the clients send authentication information 
(passwords) on a per-share basis, at the time they attempt to connect 
to that share.

Note that \fBsmbd\fR \fBALWAYS\fR 
uses a valid UNIX user to act on behalf of the client, even in
\fBsecurity = share\fR level security.

As clients are not required to send a username to the server
in share level security, \fBsmbd\fR uses several
techniques to determine the correct UNIX user to use on behalf
of the client.

A list of possible UNIX usernames to match with the given
client password is constructed using the following methods :
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If the \fIguest 
only\fR parameter is set, then all the other 
stages are missed and only the  \fIguest account\fR username is checked.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Is a username is sent with the share connection 
request, then this username (after mapping - see \fIusername map\fR), 
is added as a potential username.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If the client did a previous \fBlogon
\fRrequest (the SessionSetup SMB call) then the 
username sent in this SMB will be added as a potential username.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The name of the service the client requested is 
added as a potential username.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The NetBIOS name of the client is added to 
the list as a potential username.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Any users on the \fI user\fR list are added as potential usernames.
.RE
.PP
If the \fIguest only\fR parameter is 
not set, then this list is then tried with the supplied password. 
The first user for whom the password matches will be used as the 
UNIX user.
.PP
.PP
If the \fIguest only\fR parameter is 
set, or no username can be determined then if the share is marked 
as available to the \fIguest account\fR, then this 
guest user will be used, otherwise access is denied.
.PP
.PP
Note that it can be \fBvery\fR confusing 
in share-level security as to which UNIX username will eventually
be used in granting access.
.PP
.PP
See also the section  NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION.
.PP
.PP
\fBSECURITY = USER
\fR.PP
.PP
This is the default security setting in Samba 2.2. 
With user-level security a client must first "log-on" with a 
valid username and password (which can be mapped using the \fIusername map\fR 
parameter). Encrypted passwords (see the  \fIencrypted passwords\fR parameter) can also
be used in this security mode. Parameters such as  \fIuser\fR and  \fIguest only\fR if set are then applied and 
may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after 
the user has been successfully authenticated.
.PP
.PP
\fBNote\fR that the name of the resource being 
requested is \fBnot\fR sent to the server until after 
the server has successfully authenticated the client. This is why 
guest shares don't work in user level security without allowing 
the server to automatically map unknown users into the \fIguest account\fR. 
See the \fImap to guest\fR
parameter for details on doing this.
.PP
.PP
See also the section  NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION.
.PP
.PP
\fBSECURITY = SERVER
\fR.PP
.PP
In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password 
by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box. If this 
fails it will revert to \fBsecurity = user\fR, but note 
that if encrypted passwords have been negotiated then Samba cannot 
revert back to checking the UNIX password file, it must have a valid 
\fIsmbpasswd\fR file to check users against. See the 
documentation file in the \fIdocs/\fR directory 
\fIENCRYPTION.txt\fR for details on how to set this 
up.
.PP
.PP
\fBNote\fR that from the client's point of 
view \fBsecurity = server\fR is the same as \fB security = user\fR. It only affects how the server deals 
with the authentication, it does not in any way affect what the 
client sees.

\fBSECURITY = DOMAIN
\fR.PP
.PP
This mode will only work correctly if smbpasswd(8)has been used to add this 
machine into a Windows NT Domain. It expects the \fIencrypted passwords\fR
parameter to be set to true. In this 
mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing
it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly 
the same way that a Windows NT Server would do.
.PP
.PP
\fBNote\fR that a valid UNIX user must still 
exist as well as the account on the Domain Controller to allow 
Samba to have a valid UNIX account to map file access to.
.PP
.PP
\fBNote\fR that from the client's point 
of view \fBsecurity = domain\fR is the same as \fBsecurity = user
\fR\&. It only affects how the server deals with the authentication, 
it does not in any way affect what the client sees.

\fBBUG:\fR There is currently a bug in the 
implementation of \fBsecurity = domain\fR with respect 
to multi-byte character set usernames. The communication with a 
Domain Controller must be done in UNICODE and Samba currently 
does not widen multi-byte user names to UNICODE correctly, thus 
a multi-byte username will not be recognized correctly at the 
Domain Controller. This issue will be addressed in a future release.

.TP
\fBsecurity mask (S)\fR
This parameter controls what UNIX permission 
bits can be modified when a Windows NT client is manipulating 
the UNIX permission on a file using the native NT security 
dialog box.

This parameter is applied as a mask (AND'ed with) to 
the changed permission bits, thus preventing any bits not in 
this mask from being modified. Essentially, zero bits in this 
mask may be treated as a set of bits the user is not allowed 
to change.

If not set explicitly this parameter is 0777, allowing
a user to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a file.

\fBNote\fR that users who can access the 
Samba server through other means can easily bypass this 
restriction, so it is primarily useful for standalone 
"appliance" systems. Administrators of most normal systems will 
probably want to leave it set to 0777.

See also the  \fIforce directory security mode\fR, 
\fIdirectory 
security mask\fR,  \fIforce security mode\fR parameters.

Default: \fBsecurity mask = 0777\fR

Example: \fBsecurity mask = 0770\fR
.TP
\fBserver string (G)\fR
This controls what string will show up in the 
printer comment box in print manager and next to the IPC connection 
in \fBnet view\fR. It can be any string that you wish 
to show to your users.

It also sets what will appear in browse lists next 
to the machine name.

A \fI%v\fR will be replaced with the Samba 
version number.

A \fI%h\fR will be replaced with the 
hostname.

Default: \fBserver string = Samba %v\fR

Example: \fBserver string = University of GNUs Samba 
Server\fR
.TP
\fBset directory (S)\fR
If \fBset directory = no\fR, then 
users of the service may not use the setdir command to change 
directory.

The \fBsetdir\fR command is only implemented 
in the Digital Pathworks client. See the Pathworks documentation 
for details.

Default: \fBset directory = no\fR
.TP
\fBshare modes (S)\fR
This enables or disables the honoring of 
the \fIshare modes\fR during a file open. These 
modes are used by clients to gain exclusive read or write access 
to a file.

These open modes are not directly supported by UNIX, so
they are simulated using shared memory, or lock files if your 
UNIX doesn't support shared memory (almost all do).

The share modes that are enabled by this option are 
DENY_DOS, DENY_ALL,
DENY_READ, DENY_WRITE,
DENY_NONE and DENY_FCB.

This option gives full share compatibility and enabled 
by default.

You should \fBNEVER\fR turn this parameter 
off as many Windows applications will break if you do so.

Default: \fBshare modes = yes\fR
.TP
\fBshort preserve case (S)\fR
This boolean parameter controls if new files 
which conform to 8.3 syntax, that is all in upper case and of 
suitable length, are created upper case, or if they are forced 
to be the \fIdefault case
\fR\&. This option can be use with \fBpreserve case = yes\fR
to permit long filenames to retain their case, while short 
names are lowered. 

See the section on  NAME MANGLING.

Default: \fBshort preserve case = yes\fR
.TP
\fBshow add printer wizard (G)\fR
With the introduction of MS-RPC based printing support
for Windows NT/2000 client in Samba 2.2, a "Printers..." folder will 
appear on Samba hosts in the share listing. Normally this folder will 
contain an icon for the MS Add Printer Wizard (APW). However, it is 
possible to disable this feature regardless of the level of privilege 
of the connected user.

Under normal circumstances, the Windows NT/2000 client will 
open a handle on the printer server with OpenPrinterEx() asking for
Administrator privileges. If the user does not have administrative
access on the print server (i.e is not root or a member of the 
\fIprinter admin\fR group), the OpenPrinterEx() 
call fails and the client makes another open call with a request for 
a lower privilege level. This should succeed, however the APW 
icon will not be displayed.

Disabling the \fIshow add printer wizard\fR
parameter will always cause the OpenPrinterEx() on the server
to fail. Thus the APW icon will never be displayed. \fB Note :\fRThis does not prevent the same user from having 
administrative privilege on an individual printer.

See also \fIaddprinter
command\fR,  \fIdeleteprinter command\fR, \fIprinter admin\fR

Default :\fBshow add printer wizard = yes\fR
.TP
\fBshutdown script (G)\fR
\fBThis parameter only exists in the HEAD cvs branch\fR
This a full path name to a script called by
\fBsmbd(8)\fRthat
should start a shutdown procedure.

This command will be run as the user connected to the
server.

%m %t %r %f parameters are expanded

\fI%m\fR will be substituted with the
shutdown message sent to the server.

\fI%t\fR will be substituted with the
number of seconds to wait before effectively starting the
shutdown procedure.

\fI%r\fR will be substituted with the
switch \fB-r\fR. It means reboot after shutdown
for NT.

\fI%f\fR will be substituted with the
switch \fB-f\fR. It means force the shutdown
even if applications do not respond for NT.

Default: \fBNone\fR.

Example: \fBabort shutdown script = /usr/local/samba/sbin/shutdown %m %t %r %f\fR

Shutdown script example:
.sp
.nf
		#!/bin/bash
		
		$time=0
		let "time/60"
		let "time++"

		/sbin/shutdown $3 $4 +$time $1 &
		
.sp
.fi
Shutdown does not return so we need to launch it in background.

See also \fIabort shutdown script\fR.
.TP
\fBsmb passwd file (G)\fR
This option sets the path to the encrypted 
smbpasswd file. By default the path to the smbpasswd file 
is compiled into Samba.

Default: \fBsmb passwd file = ${prefix}/private/smbpasswd
\fR
Example: \fBsmb passwd file = /etc/samba/smbpasswd
\fR.TP
\fBsocket address (G)\fR
This option allows you to control what 
address Samba will listen for connections on. This is used to 
support multiple virtual interfaces on the one server, each 
with a different configuration.

By default Samba will accept connections on any 
address.

Example: \fBsocket address = 192.168.2.20\fR
.TP
\fBsocket options (G)\fR
This option allows you to set socket options 
to be used when talking with the client.

Socket options are controls on the networking layer 
of the operating systems which allow the connection to be 
tuned.

This option will typically be used to tune your Samba 
server for optimal performance for your local network. There is 
no way that Samba can know what the optimal parameters are for 
your net, so you must experiment and choose them yourself. We 
strongly suggest you read the appropriate documentation for your 
operating system first (perhaps \fBman setsockopt\fR 
will help).

You may find that on some systems Samba will say 
"Unknown socket option" when you supply an option. This means you 
either incorrectly typed it or you need to add an include file 
to includes.h for your OS. If the latter is the case please 
send the patch to  samba@samba.org <URL:mailto:samba@samba.org>.

Any of the supported socket options may be combined 
in any way you like, as long as your OS allows it.

This is the list of socket options currently settable 
using this option:

\fBsource environment (G)\fR
This parameter causes Samba to set environment 
variables as per the content of the file named.

If the value of this parameter starts with a "|" character 
then Samba will treat that value as a pipe command to open and 
will set the environment variables from the output of the pipe.

The contents of the file or the output of the pipe should 
be formatted as the output of the standard Unix \fBenv(1)
\fRcommand. This is of the form :

Example environment entry:

\fBSAMBA_NETBIOS_NAME = myhostname\fR

\fBssl (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your 
system and the configure option \fB--with-ssl\fR was 
given at configure time.

This variable enables or disables the entire SSL mode. If 
it is set to no, the SSL-enabled Samba behaves 
exactly like the non-SSL Samba. If set to yes, 
it depends on the variables \fI ssl hosts\fR and  \fIssl hosts resign\fR whether an SSL 
connection will be required.

Default: \fBssl = no\fR

\fBssl CA certDir (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your 
system and the configure option \fB--with-ssl\fR was 
given at configure time.

This variable defines where to look up the Certification
Authorities. The given directory should contain one file for 
each CA that Samba will trust. The file name must be the hash 
value over the "Distinguished Name" of the CA. How this directory 
is set up is explained later in this document. All files within the 
directory that don't fit into this naming scheme are ignored. You 
don't need this variable if you don't verify client certificates.

Default: \fBssl CA certDir = /usr/local/ssl/certs
\fR.TP
\fBssl CA certFile (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your 
system and the configure option \fB--with-ssl\fR was 
given at configure time.

This variable is a second way to define the trusted CAs. 
The certificates of the trusted CAs are collected in one big 
file and this variable points to the file. You will probably 
only use one of the two ways to define your CAs. The first choice is 
preferable if you have many CAs or want to be flexible, the second 
is preferable if you only have one CA and want to keep things 
simple (you won't need to create the hashed file names). You 
don't need this variable if you don't verify client certificates.

Default: \fBssl CA certFile = /usr/local/ssl/certs/trustedCAs.pem

\fBssl ciphers (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your

This variable defines the ciphers that should be offered 
during SSL negotiation. You should not set this variable unless 
you know what you are doing.

\fBssl client cert (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your

The certificate in this file is used by  \fBsmbclient(1)\fRif it exists. It's needed 
if the server requires a client certificate.

Default: \fBssl client cert = /usr/local/ssl/certs/smbclient.pem

\fBssl client key (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This

\fBssl compatibility (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your

This variable defines whether OpenSSL should be configured 
for bug compatibility with other SSL implementations. This is 
probably not desirable because currently no clients with SSL 
implementations other than OpenSSL exist.

\fBssl egd socket (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your

This option is used to define the location of the communiation socket of 
an EGD or PRNGD daemon, from which entropy can be retrieved. This option 
can be used instead of or together with the \fIssl entropy file\fR 
directive. 255 bytes of entropy will be retrieved from the daemon.

.TP
\fBssl hosts resign (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your 
system and the configure option \fB--with-ssl\fR was 
given at configure time.

These two variables define whether Samba will go 
into SSL mode or not. If none of them is defined, Samba will 
allow only SSL connections. If the  \fIssl hosts\fR variable lists
hosts (by IP-address, IP-address range, net group or name), 
only these hosts will be forced into SSL mode. If the \fI ssl hosts resign\fR variable lists hosts, only these 
hosts will \fBNOT\fR be forced into SSL mode. The syntax for these two 
variables is the same as for the \fI hosts allow\fR and  \fIhosts deny\fR pair of variables, only 
that the subject of the decision is different: It's not the access 
right but whether SSL is used or not. 

The example below requires SSL connections from all hosts
outside the local net (which is 192.168.*.*).

Default: \fBssl hosts = <empty string>\fR

\fBssl hosts resign = <empty string>\fR

Example: \fBssl hosts resign = 192.168.\fR
.TP
\fBssl require clientcert (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your 
system and the configure option \fB--with-ssl\fR was 
given at configure time.

If this variable is set to yes, the 
server will not tolerate connections from clients that don't 
have a valid certificate. The directory/file given in \fIssl CA certDir\fR
and \fIssl CA certFile
\fRwill be used to look up the CAs that issued 
the client's certificate. If the certificate can't be verified 
positively, the connection will be terminated. If this variable 
is set to no, clients don't need certificates. 
Contrary to web applications you really \fBshould\fR 
require client certificates. In the web environment the client's 
data is sensitive (credit card numbers) and the server must prove 
to be trustworthy. In a file server environment the server's data 
will be sensitive and the clients must prove to be trustworthy.

Default: \fBssl require clientcert = no\fR
.TP
\fBssl require servercert (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your 
system and the configure option \fB--with-ssl\fR was 
given at configure time.

If this variable is set to yes, the 
\fBsmbclient(1)\fR
will request a certificate from the server. Same as 
\fIssl require 
clientcert\fR for the server.

Default: \fBssl require servercert = no\fR
.TP
\fBssl server cert (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your 
system and the configure option \fB--with-ssl\fR was 
given at configure time.

This is the file containing the server's certificate. 
The server \fBmust\fR have a certificate. The 
file may also contain the server's private key. See later for 
how certificates and private keys are created.

Default: \fBssl server cert = <empty string>
\fR.TP
\fBssl server key (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your 
system and the configure option \fB--with-ssl\fR was 
given at configure time.

This file contains the private key of the server. If 
this variable is not defined, the key is looked up in the 
certificate file (it may be appended to the certificate). 
The server \fBmust\fR have a private key
and the certificate \fBmust\fR 
match this private key.

Default: \fBssl server key = <empty string>
\fR.TP
\fBssl version (G)\fR
This variable is part of SSL-enabled Samba. This 
is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your 
system and the configure option \fB--with-ssl\fR was 
given at configure time.

This enumeration variable defines the versions of the 
SSL protocol that will be used. ssl2or3 allows 
dynamic negotiation of SSL v2 or v3, ssl2 results 
in SSL v2, ssl3 results in SSL v3 and
tls1 results in TLS v1. TLS (Transport Layer 
Security) is the new standard for SSL.

Default: \fBssl version = "ssl2or3"\fR
.TP
\fBstat cache (G)\fR
This parameter determines if smbd(8)will use a cache in order to 
speed up case insensitive name mappings. You should never need 
to change this parameter.

Default: \fBstat cache = yes\fR
.TP
\fBstat cache size (G)\fR
This parameter determines the number of 
entries in the \fIstat cache\fR. You should 
never need to change this parameter.

Default: \fBstat cache size = 50\fR
.TP
\fBstatus (G)\fR
This enables or disables logging of connections 
to a status file that smbstatus(1)
can read.

With this disabled \fBsmbstatus\fR won't be able
to tell you what connections are active. You should never need to
change this parameter.

Default: \fBstatus = yes\fR
.TP
\fBstrict allocate (S)\fR
This is a boolean that controls the handling of 
disk space allocation in the server. When this is set to yes 
the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real
disk storage blocks when a file is extended to the Windows behaviour
of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks
when a file is created or extended to be a given size. In UNIX
terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files.
This can be slow on some systems.

When strict allocate is no the server does sparse
disk block allocation when a file is extended.

Setting this to yes can help Samba return
out of quota messages on systems that are restricting the disk quota
of users.

Default: \fBstrict allocate = no\fR
.TP
\fBstrict locking (S)\fR
This is a boolean that controls the handling of 
file locking in the server. When this is set to yes 
the server will check every read and write access for file locks, and 
deny access if locks exist. This can be slow on some systems.

When strict locking is no the server does file 
lock checks only when the client explicitly asks for them.

Well-behaved clients always ask for lock checks when it 
is important, so in the vast majority of cases \fBstrict 
locking = no\fR is preferable.

Default: \fBstrict locking = no\fR
.TP
\fBstrict sync (S)\fR
Many Windows applications (including the Windows 
98 explorer shell) seem to confuse flushing buffer contents to 
disk with doing a sync to disk. Under UNIX, a sync call forces 
the process to be suspended until the kernel has ensured that 
all outstanding data in kernel disk buffers has been safely stored 
onto stable storage. This is very slow and should only be done 
rarely. Setting this parameter to no (the 
default) means that smbdignores the Windows applications requests for
a sync call. There is only a possibility of losing data if the
operating system itself that Samba is running on crashes, so there is
little danger in this default setting. In addition, this fixes many
performance problems that people have reported with the new Windows98
explorer shell file copies.

See also the \fIsync 
always>\fR parameter.

Default: \fBstrict sync = no\fR
.TP
\fBstrip dot (G)\fR
This is a boolean that controls whether to 
strip trailing dots off UNIX filenames. This helps with some 
CDROMs that have filenames ending in a single dot.

Default: \fBstrip dot = no\fR
.TP
\fBsync always (S)\fR
This is a boolean parameter that controls 
whether writes will always be written to stable storage before 
the write call returns. If this is false then the server will be 
guided by the client's request in each write call (clients can 
set a bit indicating that a particular write should be synchronous). 
If this is true then every write will be followed by a \fBfsync()
\fRcall to ensure the data is written to disk. Note that 
the \fIstrict sync\fR parameter must be set to
yes in order for this parameter to have 
any affect.

See also the \fIstrict 
sync\fR parameter.

Default: \fBsync always = no\fR
.TP
\fBsyslog (G)\fR
This parameter maps how Samba debug messages 
are logged onto the system syslog logging levels. Samba debug 
level zero maps onto syslog LOG_ERR, debug 
level one maps onto LOG_WARNING, debug level 
two maps onto LOG_NOTICE, debug level three 
maps onto LOG_INFO. All higher levels are mapped to  LOG_DEBUG.

This parameter sets the threshold for sending messages 
to syslog. Only messages with debug level less than this value 
will be sent to syslog.

Default: \fBsyslog = 1\fR
.TP
\fBsyslog only (G)\fR
If this parameter is set then Samba debug 
messages are logged into the system syslog only, and not to 
the debug log files.

Default: \fBsyslog only = no\fR
.TP
\fBtemplate homedir (G)\fR
When filling out the user information for a Windows NT 
user, the winbindd(8)daemon 
uses this parameter to fill in the home directory for that user. 
If the string \fI%D\fR is present it is substituted 
with the user's Windows NT domain name. If the string \fI%U
\fRis present it is substituted with the user's Windows 
NT user name.

Default: \fBtemplate homedir = /home/%D/%U\fR
.TP
\fBtemplate shell (G)\fR
When filling out the user information for a Windows NT 
user, the winbindd(8)daemon 
uses this parameter to fill in the login shell for that user.

Default: \fBtemplate shell = /bin/false\fR
.TP
\fBtime offset (G)\fR
This parameter is a setting in minutes to add 
to the normal GMT to local time conversion. This is useful if 
you are serving a lot of PCs that have incorrect daylight 
saving time handling.

Default: \fBtime offset = 0\fR

Example: \fBtime offset = 60\fR
.TP
\fBtime server (G)\fR
This parameter determines if  
nmbd(8)advertises itself as a time server to Windows 
clients.

Default: \fBtime server = no\fR
.TP
\fBtimestamp logs (G)\fR
Synonym for \fI debug timestamp\fR.
.TP
\fBtotal print jobs (G)\fR
This parameter accepts an integer value which defines
a limit on the maximum number of print jobs that will be accepted 
system wide at any given time. If a print job is submitted
by a client which will exceed this number, then smbdwill return an 
error indicating that no space is available on the server. The 
default value of 0 means that no such limit exists. This parameter
can be used to prevent a server from exceeding its capacity and is
designed as a printing throttle. See also 
\fImax print jobs\fR.

Default: \fBtotal print jobs = 0\fR

Example: \fBtotal print jobs = 5000\fR
.TP
\fBunix extensions(G)\fR
This boolean parameter controls whether Samba 
implments the CIFS UNIX extensions, as defined by HP. These
extensions enable CIFS to server UNIX clients to UNIX servers
better, and allow such things as symbolic links, hard links etc.
These extensions require a similarly enabled client, and are of
no current use to Windows clients.

Default: \fBunix extensions = no\fR
.TP
\fBunix password sync (G)\fR
This boolean parameter controls whether Samba 
attempts to synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password 
when the encrypted SMB password in the smbpasswd file is changed. 
If this is set to true the program specified in the \fIpasswd
program\fRparameter is called \fBAS ROOT\fR - 
to allow the new UNIX password to be set without access to the 
old UNIX password (as the SMB password change code has no 
access to the old password cleartext, only the new).

See also \fIpasswd 
program\fR, \fI passwd chat\fR.

Default: \fBunix password sync = no\fR
.TP
\fBupdate encrypted (G)\fR
This boolean parameter allows a user logging 
on with a plaintext password to have their encrypted (hashed) 
password in the smbpasswd file to be updated automatically as 
they log on. This option allows a site to migrate from plaintext 
password authentication (users authenticate with plaintext 
password over the wire, and are checked against a UNIX account 
database) to encrypted password authentication (the SMB 
challenge/response authentication mechanism) without forcing
all users to re-enter their passwords via smbpasswd at the time the
change is made. This is a convenience option to allow the change over
to encrypted passwords to be made over a longer period. Once all users
have encrypted representations of their passwords in the smbpasswd
file this parameter should be set to no.

In order for this parameter to work correctly the \fIencrypt passwords\fR
parameter must be set to no when
this parameter is set to yes.

Note that even when this parameter is set a user 
authenticating to \fBsmbd\fR must still enter a valid 
password in order to connect correctly, and to update their hashed 
(smbpasswd) passwords.

Default: \fBupdate encrypted = no\fR
.TP
\fBuse client driver (S)\fR
This parameter applies only to Windows NT/2000
clients. It has no affect on Windows 95/98/ME clients. When 
serving a printer to Windows NT/2000 clients without first installing
a valid printer driver on the Samba host, the client will be required
to install a local printer driver. From this point on, the client
will treat the print as a local printer and not a network printer 
connection. This is much the same behavior that will occur
when \fBdisable spoolss = yes\fR. 

The differentiating 
factor is that under normal circumstances, the NT/2000 client will 
attempt to open the network printer using MS-RPC. The problem is that
because the client considers the printer to be local, it will attempt
to issue the OpenPrinterEx() call requesting access rights associated 
with the logged on user. If the user possesses local administator rights
but not root privilegde on the Samba host (often the case), the OpenPrinterEx()
call will fail. The result is that the client will now display an "Access
Denied; Unable to connect" message in the printer queue window (even though
jobs may successfully be printed). 

If this parameter is enabled for a printer, then any attempt
to open the printer with the PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER right is mapped
to PRINTER_ACCESS_USE instead. Thus allowing the OpenPrinterEx()
call to succeed. \fBThis parameter MUST not be able enabled
on a print share which has valid print driver installed on the Samba 
server.\fR

See also disable spoolss

Default: \fBuse client driver = no\fR
.TP
\fBuse mmap (G)\fR
This global parameter determines if the tdb internals of Samba can
depend on mmap working correctly on the running system. Samba requires a coherent
mmap/read-write system memory cache. Currently only HPUX does not have such a
coherent cache, and so this parameter is set to false by
default on HPUX. On all other systems this parameter should be left alone. This
parameter is provided to help the Samba developers track down problems with
the tdb internal code.

Default: \fBuse mmap = yes\fR
.TP
\fBuse rhosts (G)\fR
If this global parameter is true, it specifies 
that the UNIX user's \fI.rhosts\fR file in their home directory 
will be read to find the names of hosts and users who will be allowed 
access without specifying a password.

\fBNOTE:\fR The use of \fIuse rhosts
\fRcan be a major security hole. This is because you are 
trusting the PC to supply the correct username. It is very easy to 
get a PC to supply a false username. I recommend that the \fI use rhosts\fR option be only used if you really know what 
you are doing.

Default: \fBuse rhosts = no\fR
.TP
\fBuser (S)\fR
Synonym for \fI username\fR.
.TP
\fBusers (S)\fR
Synonym for \fI username\fR.
.TP
\fBusername (S)\fR
Multiple users may be specified in a comma-delimited 
list, in which case the supplied password will be tested against 
each username in turn (left to right).

The \fIusername\fR line is needed only when 
the PC is unable to supply its own username. This is the case 
for the COREPLUS protocol or where your users have different WfWg 
usernames to UNIX usernames. In both these cases you may also be 
better using the \\\\server\\share%user syntax instead.

The \fIusername\fR line is not a great 
solution in many cases as it means Samba will try to validate 
the supplied password against each of the usernames in the 
\fIusername\fR line in turn. This is slow and 
a bad idea for lots of users in case of duplicate passwords. 
You may get timeouts or security breaches using this parameter 
unwisely.

Samba relies on the underlying UNIX security. This 
parameter does not restrict who can login, it just offers hints 
to the Samba server as to what usernames might correspond to the 
supplied password. Users can login as whoever they please and 
they will be able to do no more damage than if they started a 
telnet session. The daemon runs as the user that they log in as, 
so they cannot do anything that user cannot do.

To restrict a service to a particular set of users you 
can use the \fIvalid users
\fRparameter.

If any of the usernames begin with a '@' then the name 
will be looked up first in the NIS netgroups list (if Samba 
is compiled with netgroup support), followed by a lookup in 
the UNIX groups database and will expand to a list of all users 
in the group of that name.

If any of the usernames begin with a '+' then the name 
will be looked up only in the UNIX groups database and will 
expand to a list of all users in the group of that name.

If any of the usernames begin with a '&'then the name 
will be looked up only in the NIS netgroups database (if Samba 
is compiled with netgroup support) and will expand to a list 
of all users in the netgroup group of that name.

Note that searching though a groups database can take 
quite some time, and some clients may time out during the 
search.

See the section NOTE ABOUT 
USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION for more information on how 
this parameter determines access to the services.

Default: \fBThe guest account if a guest service, 
else <empty string>.\fR

Examples:\fBusername = fred, mary, jack, jane, 
@users, @pcgroup\fR
.TP
\fBusername level (G)\fR
This option helps Samba to try and 'guess' at 
the real UNIX username, as many DOS clients send an all-uppercase 
username. By default Samba tries all lowercase, followed by the 
username with the first letter capitalized, and fails if the 
username is not found on the UNIX machine.

If this parameter is set to non-zero the behavior changes. 
This parameter is a number that specifies the number of uppercase
combinations to try while trying to determine the UNIX user name. The
higher the number the more combinations will be tried, but the slower
the discovery of usernames will be. Use this parameter when you have
strange usernames on your UNIX machine, such as AstrangeUser
\&.

Default: \fBusername level = 0\fR

Example: \fBusername level = 5\fR
.TP
\fBusername map (G)\fR
This option allows you to specify a file containing 
a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server. This can be 
used for several purposes. The most common is to map usernames 
that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX 
box uses. The other is to map multiple users to a single username 
so that they can more easily share files.

The map file is parsed line by line. Each line should 
contain a single UNIX username on the left then a '=' followed 
by a list of usernames on the right. The list of usernames on the 
right may contain names of the form @group in which case they 
will match any UNIX username in that group. The special client 
name '*' is a wildcard and matches any name. Each line of the 
map file may be up to 1023 characters long.

The file is processed on each line by taking the 
supplied username and comparing it with each username on the right 
hand side of the '=' signs. If the supplied name matches any of 
the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the name 
on the left. Processing then continues with the next line.

If any line begins with a '#' or a ';' then it is 
ignored

If any line begins with an '!' then the processing 
will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the line. 
Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed. 
Using '!' is most useful when you have a wildcard mapping line 
later in the file.

For example to map from the name admin 
or administrator to the UNIX name  root you would use:

\fBroot = admin administrator\fR

Or to map anyone in the UNIX group system 
to the UNIX name sys you would use:

\fBsys = @system\fR

You can have as many mappings as you like in a username 
map file.

If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then 
the netgroup database is checked before the \fI/etc/group
\fRdatabase for matching groups.

You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them
by using double quotes around the name. For example:

\fBtridge = "Andrew Tridgell"\fR

would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the 
unix username "tridge".

The following example would map mary and fred to the 
unix user sys, and map the rest to guest. Note the use of the 
\&'!' to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on 
that line.

.sp
.nf
		!sys = mary fred
		guest = *
		
.sp
.fi

Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences 
of usernames. Thus if you connect to \\\\server\\fred and  fred is remapped to mary then you 
will actually be connecting to \\\\server\\mary and will need to 
supply a password suitable for mary not 
fred. The only exception to this is the 
username passed to the \fI password server\fR (if you have one). The password 
server will receive whatever username the client supplies without 
modification.

Also note that no reverse mapping is done. The main effect 
this has is with printing. Users who have been mapped may have 
trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think 
they don't own the print job.

Default: \fBno username map\fR

Example: \fBusername map = /usr/local/samba/lib/users.map
\fR.TP
\fButmp (G)\fR
This boolean parameter is only available if 
Samba has been configured and compiled with the option \fB --with-utmp\fR. If set to true then Samba will attempt
to add utmp or utmpx records (depending on the UNIX system) whenever a
connection is made to a Samba server. Sites may use this to record the
user connecting to a Samba share.

See also the \fI utmp directory\fR parameter.

Default: \fButmp = no\fR
.TP
\fButmp directory(G)\fR
This parameter is only available if Samba has 
been configured and compiled with the option \fB --with-utmp\fR. It specifies a directory pathname that is
used to store the utmp or utmpx files (depending on the UNIX system) that
record user connections to a Samba server. See also the  \fIutmp\fR parameter. By default this is 
not set, meaning the system will use whatever utmp file the 
native system is set to use (usually 
\fI/var/run/utmp\fR on Linux).

Default: \fBno utmp directory\fR
.TP
\fBvalid chars (G)\fR
The option allows you to specify additional 
characters that should be considered valid by the server in 
filenames. This is particularly useful for national character 
sets, such as adding u-umlaut or a-ring.

The option takes a list of characters in either integer 
or character form with spaces between them. If you give two 
characters with a colon between them then it will be taken as 
an lowercase:uppercase pair.

If you have an editor capable of entering the characters 
into the config file then it is probably easiest to use this 
method. Otherwise you can specify the characters in octal, 
decimal or hexadecimal form using the usual C notation.

For example to add the single character 'Z' to the charset 
(which is a pointless thing to do as it's already there) you could 
do one of the following

.sp
.nf
		valid chars = Z
		valid chars = z:Z
		valid chars = 0132:0172
		
.sp
.fi

The last two examples above actually add two characters, 
and alter the uppercase and lowercase mappings appropriately.

Note that you \fBMUST\fR specify this parameter 
after the \fIclient code page\fR parameter if you 
have both set. If \fIclient code page\fR is set after 
the \fIvalid chars\fR parameter the \fIvalid 
chars\fR settings will be overwritten.

See also the \fIclient 
code page\fR parameter.

Default: \fBSamba defaults to using a reasonable set 
of valid characters for English systems\fR

Example: \fBvalid chars = 0345:0305 0366:0326 0344:0304
\fR
The above example allows filenames to have the Swedish 
characters in them.

\fBNOTE:\fR It is actually quite difficult to 
correctly produce a \fIvalid chars\fR line for 
a particular system. To automate the process tino@augsburg.net <URL:mailto:tino@augsburg.net> has written 
a package called \fBvalidchars\fR which will automatically 
produce a complete \fIvalid chars\fR line for
a given client system. Look in the \fIexamples/validchars/
\fRsubdirectory of your Samba source code distribution 
for this package.
.TP
\fBvalid users (S)\fR
This is a list of users that should be allowed 
to login to this service. Names starting with '@', '+' and '&'
are interpreted using the same rules as described in the 
\fIinvalid users\fR parameter.

If this is empty (the default) then any user can login. 
If a username is in both this list and the \fIinvalid 
users\fR list then access is denied for that user.

The current servicename is substituted for \fI%S
\fR\&. This is useful in the [homes] section.

See also \fIinvalid users
\fR
Default: \fBNo valid users list (anyone can login)
\fR
Example: \fBvalid users = greg, @pcusers\fR
.TP
\fBveto files(S)\fR
This is a list of files and directories that 
are neither visible nor accessible. Each entry in the list must 
be separated by a '/', which allows spaces to be included 
in the entry. '*' and '?' can be used to specify multiple files 
or directories as in DOS wildcards.

Each entry must be a unix path, not a DOS path and 
must \fBnot\fR include the unix directory 
separator '/'.

Note that the \fIcase sensitive\fR option 
is applicable in vetoing files.

One feature of the veto files parameter that it
is important to be aware of is Samba's behaviour when
trying to delete a directory. If a directory that is
to be deleted contains nothing but veto files this
deletion will \fBfail\fR unless you also set
the \fIdelete veto files\fR parameter to
\fIyes\fR.

Setting this parameter will affect the performance 
of Samba, as it will be forced to check all files and directories 
for a match as they are scanned.

See also \fIhide files
\fRand \fI case sensitive\fR.

Default: \fBNo files or directories are vetoed.
\fR
Examples:
.sp
.nf
; Veto any files containing the word Security, 
; any ending in .tmp, and any directory containing the
; word root.
veto files = /*Security*/*.tmp/*root*/

; Veto the Apple specific files that a NetAtalk server
; creates.
veto files = /.AppleDouble/.bin/.AppleDesktop/Network Trash Folder/
.sp
.fi
.TP
\fBveto oplock files (S)\fR
This parameter is only valid when the \fIoplocks\fR
parameter is turned on for a share. It allows the Samba administrator
to selectively turn off the granting of oplocks on selected files that
match a wildcarded list, similar to the wildcarded list used in the
\fIveto files\fR 
parameter.

Default: \fBNo files are vetoed for oplock 
grants\fR

You might want to do this on files that you know will 
be heavily contended for by clients. A good example of this 
is in the NetBench SMB benchmark program, which causes heavy 
client contention for files ending in \fI.SEM\fR. 
To cause Samba not to grant oplocks on these files you would use 
the line (either in the [global] section or in the section for 
the particular NetBench share :

Example: \fBveto oplock files = /*.SEM/
\fR.TP
\fBvfs object (S)\fR
This parameter specifies a shared object file that 
is used for Samba VFS I/O operations. By default, normal 
disk I/O operations are used but these can be overloaded 
with a VFS object. The Samba VFS layer is new to Samba 2.2 and 
must be enabled at compile time with --with-vfs.

Default : \fBno value\fR
.TP
\fBvfs options (S)\fR
This parameter allows parameters to be passed 
to the vfs layer at initialization time. The Samba VFS layer 
is new to Samba 2.2 and must be enabled at compile time 
with --with-vfs. See also \fI vfs object\fR.

Default : \fBno value\fR
.TP
\fBvolume (S)\fR
This allows you to override the volume label 
returned for a share. Useful for CDROMs with installation programs 
that insist on a particular volume label.

Default: \fBthe name of the share\fR
.TP
\fBwide links (S)\fR
This parameter controls whether or not links 
in the UNIX file system may be followed by the server. Links 
that point to areas within the directory tree exported by the 
server are always allowed; this parameter controls access only 
to areas that are outside the directory tree being exported.

Note that setting this parameter can have a negative 
effect on your server performance due to the extra system calls 
that Samba has to do in order to perform the link checks.

Default: \fBwide links = yes\fR
.TP
\fBwinbind cache time\fR
This parameter specifies the number of seconds the
winbindd(8)daemon will cache 
user and group information before querying a Windows NT server 
again.

Default: \fBwinbind cache type = 15\fR
.TP
\fBwinbind enum users\fR
On large installations using
winbindd(8)it may be
necessary to suppress the enumeration of users through the
\fBsetpwent()\fR,
\fBgetpwent()\fR and
\fBendpwent()\fR group of system calls. If
the \fIwinbind enum users\fR parameter is
false, calls to the \fBgetpwent\fR system call
will not return any data. 

\fBWarning:\fR Turning off user
enumeration may cause some programs to behave oddly. For
example, the finger program relies on having access to the
full user list when searching for matching
usernames. 

Default: \fBwinbind enum users = yes \fR
.TP
\fBwinbind enum groups\fR
On large installations using
winbindd(8)it may be
necessary to suppress the enumeration of groups through the
\fBsetgrent()\fR,
\fBgetgrent()\fR and
\fBendgrent()\fR group of system calls. If
the \fIwinbind enum groups\fR parameter is
false, calls to the \fBgetgrent()\fR system
call will not return any data. 

\fBWarning:\fR Turning off group
enumeration may cause some programs to behave oddly.

Default: \fBwinbind enum groups = yes \fR
.TP
\fBwinbind gid\fR
The winbind gid parameter specifies the range of group 
ids that are allocated by the  winbindd(8)daemon. This range of group ids should have no 
existing local or NIS groups within it as strange conflicts can 
occur otherwise.

Default: \fBwinbind gid = <empty string>
\fR
Example: \fBwinbind gid = 10000-20000\fR
.TP
\fBwinbind separator\fR
This parameter allows an admin to define the character 
used when listing a username of the form of \fIDOMAIN
\fR\\\fIuser\fR. This parameter 
is only applicable when using the \fIpam_winbind.so\fR
and \fInss_winbind.so\fR modules for UNIX services.

Please note that setting this parameter to + causes problems
with group membership at least on glibc systems, as the character +
is used as a special character for NIS in /etc/group.

Example: \fBwinbind separator = \\\\\fR

Example: \fBwinbind separator = /\fR
.TP
\fBwinbind uid\fR
The winbind gid parameter specifies the range of group 
ids that are allocated by the  winbindd(8)daemon. This range of ids should have no 
existing local or NIS users within it as strange conflicts can 
occur otherwise.

Default: \fBwinbind uid = <empty string>
\fR
Example: \fBwinbind uid = 10000-20000\fR
.TP
\fBwins hook (G)\fR
When Samba is running as a WINS server this 
allows you to call an external program for all changes to the 
WINS database. The primary use for this option is to allow the 
dynamic update of external name resolution databases such as 
dynamic DNS.

The wins hook parameter specifies the name of a script 
or executable that will be called as follows:

\fBwins_hook operation name nametype ttl IP_list
\fR.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The first argument is the operation and is one 
of "add", "delete", or "refresh". In most cases the operation can 
be ignored as the rest of the parameters provide sufficient 
information. Note that "refresh" may sometimes be called when the 
name has not previously been added, in that case it should be treated 
as an add.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The second argument is the NetBIOS name. If the 
name is not a legal name then the wins hook is not called. 
Legal names contain only letters, digits, hyphens, underscores 
and periods.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The third argument is the NetBIOS name 
type as a 2 digit hexadecimal number. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The fourth argument is the TTL (time to live) 
for the name in seconds.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The fifth and subsequent arguments are the IP 
addresses currently registered for that name. If this list is 
empty then the name should be deleted.
.RE
.PP
An example script that calls the BIND dynamic DNS update 
program \fBnsupdate\fR is provided in the examples 
directory of the Samba source code. 
.PP
.TP
\fBwins proxy (G)\fR
This is a boolean that controls if nmbd(8)will respond to broadcast name 
queries on behalf of other hosts. You may need to set this 
to yes for some older clients.

Default: \fBwins proxy = no\fR
.TP
\fBwins server (G)\fR
This specifies the IP address (or DNS name: IP 
address for preference) of the WINS server that  nmbd(8)should register with. If you have a WINS server on 
your network then you should set this to the WINS server's IP.

You should point this at your WINS server if you have a
multi-subnetted network.

\fBNOTE\fR. You need to set up Samba to point 
to a WINS server if you have multiple subnets and wish cross-subnet 
browsing to work correctly.

See the documentation file \fIBROWSING.txt\fR 
in the docs/ directory of your Samba source distribution.

Default: \fBnot enabled\fR

Example: \fBwins server = 192.9.200.1\fR
.TP
\fBwins support (G)\fR
This boolean controls if the  
nmbd(8)process in Samba will act as a WINS server. You should 
not set this to true unless you have a multi-subnetted network and 
you wish a particular \fBnmbd\fR to be your WINS server. 
Note that you should \fBNEVER\fR set this to true
on more than one machine in your network.

Default: \fBwins support = no\fR
.TP
\fBworkgroup (G)\fR
This controls what workgroup your server will 
appear to be in when queried by clients. Note that this parameter 
also controls the Domain name used with the \fBsecurity = domain\fR
setting.

Default: \fBset at compile time to WORKGROUP\fR

Example: \fBworkgroup = MYGROUP\fR
.TP
\fBwritable (S)\fR
Synonym for \fI writeable\fR for people who can't spell :-).
.TP
\fBwrite cache size (S)\fR
If this integer parameter is set to non-zero value,
Samba will create an in-memory cache for each oplocked file 
(it does \fBnot\fR do this for 
non-oplocked files). All writes that the client does not request 
to be flushed directly to disk will be stored in this cache if possible. 
The cache is flushed onto disk when a write comes in whose offset 
would not fit into the cache or when the file is closed by the client. 
Reads for the file are also served from this cache if the data is stored 
within it.

This cache allows Samba to batch client writes into a more 
efficient write size for RAID disks (i.e. writes may be tuned to 
be the RAID stripe size) and can improve performance on systems 
where the disk subsystem is a bottleneck but there is free 
memory for userspace programs.

The integer parameter specifies the size of this cache 
(per oplocked file) in bytes.

Default: \fBwrite cache size = 0\fR

Example: \fBwrite cache size = 262144\fR

for a 256k cache size per file.
.TP
\fBwrite list (S)\fR
This is a list of users that are given read-write 
access to a service. If the connecting user is in this list then 
they will be given write access, no matter what the \fIwriteable\fR
option is set to. The list can include group names using the 
@group syntax.

Note that if a user is in both the read list and the 
write list then they will be given write access.

See also the \fIread list
\fRoption.

Default: \fBwrite list = <empty string>
\fR
Example: \fBwrite list = admin, root, @staff
\fR.TP
\fBwrite ok (S)\fR
Synonym for \fI writeable\fR.
.TP
\fBwrite raw (G)\fR
This parameter controls whether or not the server 
will support raw write SMB's when transferring data from clients. 
You should never need to change this parameter.

Default: \fBwrite raw = yes\fR
.TP
\fBwriteable (S)\fR
An inverted synonym is  \fIread only\fR.

If this parameter is no, then users 
of a service may not create or modify files in the service's 
directory.

Note that a printable service (\fBprintable = yes\fR)
will \fBALWAYS\fR allow writing to the directory 
(user privileges permitting), but only via spooling operations.

Default: \fBwriteable = no\fR
.SH "WARNINGS"
.PP
Although the configuration file permits service names 
to contain spaces, your client software may not. Spaces will 
be ignored in comparisons anyway, so it shouldn't be a 
problem - but be aware of the possibility.
.PP
On a similar note, many clients - especially DOS clients - 
limit service names to eight characters. smbd(8)
has no such limitation, but attempts to connect from such 
clients will fail if they truncate the service names. For this reason 
you should probably keep your service names down to eight characters 
in length.
.PP
Use of the [homes] and [printers] special sections make life 
for an administrator easy, but the various combinations of default 
attributes can be tricky. Take extreme care when designing these 
sections. In particular, ensure that the permissions on spool 
directories are correct.

The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
