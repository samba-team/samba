smbclient \- ftp-like client to access SMB/CIFS resources  on servers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBsmbclient\fR \fBservicename\fR [ \fBpassword\fR ]  [ \fB-b <buffer size>\fR ]  [ \fB-d debuglevel\fR ]  [ \fB-D Directory\fR ]  [ \fB-U username\fR ]  [ \fB-W workgroup\fR ]  [ \fB-M <netbios name>\fR ]  [ \fB-m maxprotocol\fR ]  [ \fB-A authfile\fR ]  [ \fB-N\fR ]  [ \fB-l logfile\fR ]  [ \fB-L <netbios name>\fR ]  [ \fB-I destinationIP\fR ]  [ \fB-E <terminal code>\fR ]  [ \fB-c <command string>\fR ]  [ \fB-i scope\fR ]  [ \fB-O <socket options>\fR ]  [ \fB-p port\fR ]  [ \fB-R <name resolve order>\fR ]  [ \fB-s <smb config file>\fR ]  [ \fB-T<c|x>IXFqgbNan\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
\fBsmbclient\fR is a client that can 
\&'talk' to an SMB/CIFS server. It offers an interface
similar to that of the ftp program (see \fBftp(1)\fR). 
Operations include things like getting files from the server 
to the local machine, putting files from the local machine to 
the server, retrieving directory information from the server 
and so on. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBservicename\fR
servicename is the name of the service 
you want to use on the server. A service name takes the form
\fI//server/service\fR where \fIserver
\fRis the NetBIOS name of the SMB/CIFS server 
offering the desired service and \fIservice\fR 
is the name of the service offered. Thus to connect to 
the service "printer" on the SMB/CIFS server "smbserver",
you would use the servicename \fI//smbserver/printer
\fR
Note that the server name required is NOT necessarily 
the IP (DNS) host name of the server ! The name required is 
a NetBIOS server name, which may or may not be the
same as the IP hostname of the machine running the server.

The server name is looked up according to either 
the \fI-R\fR parameter to \fBsmbclient\fR or 
using the name resolve order parameter in the \fIsmb.conf\fR file, 
allowing an administrator to change the order and methods 
by which server names are looked up. 
.TP
\fBpassword\fR
The password required to access the specified 
service on the specified server. If this parameter is 
supplied, the \fI-N\fR option (suppress 
password prompt) is assumed. 

There is no default password. If no password is supplied 
on the command line (either by using this parameter or adding 
a password to the \fI-U\fR option (see 
below)) and the \fI-N\fR option is not 
specified, the client will prompt for a password, even if 
the desired service does not require one. (If no password is 
required, simply press ENTER to provide a null password.)

Note: Some servers (including OS/2 and Windows for 
Workgroups) insist on an uppercase password. Lowercase 
or mixed case passwords may be rejected by these servers. 

Be cautious about including passwords in scripts.
.TP
\fB-s smb.conf\fR
Specifies the location of the all important 
\fIsmb.conf\fR file. 
.TP
\fB-O socket options\fR
TCP socket options to set on the client 
socket. See the socket options parameter in the \fI smb.conf (5)\fR manpage for the list of valid 
options. 
.TP
\fB-R <name resolve order>\fR
This option is used by the programs in the Samba 
suite to determine what naming services and in what order to resolve 
host names to IP addresses. The option takes a space-separated 
string of different name resolution options.

The options are :"lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They 
cause names to be resolved as follows :
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
lmhosts : Lookup an IP 
address in the Samba lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has 
no name type attached to the NetBIOS name (see the lmhosts(5)for details) then
any name type matches for lookup.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
host : Do a standard host 
name to IP address resolution, using the system \fI/etc/hosts
\fR, NIS, or DNS lookups. This method of name resolution 
is operating system dependent, for instance on IRIX or Solaris this 
may be controlled by the \fI/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR 
file). Note that this method is only used if the NetBIOS name 
type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise 
it is ignored.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
wins : Query a name with 
the IP address listed in the \fIwins server\fR
parameter. If no WINS server has
been specified this method will be ignored.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
bcast : Do a broadcast on 
each of the known local interfaces listed in the 
\fIinterfaces\fR
parameter. This is the least reliable of the name resolution 
methods as it depends on the target host being on a locally 
connected subnet.
.RE
.PP
If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order 
defined in the \fIsmb.conf\fR file parameter 
(name resolve order) will be used. 
.PP
.PP
The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast and without 
this parameter or any entry in the \fIname resolve order
\fRparameter of the \fIsmb.conf\fR file the name resolution
methods will be attempted in this order. 
.PP
.TP
\fB-M NetBIOS name\fR
This options allows you to send messages, using 
the "WinPopup" protocol, to another computer. Once a connection is 
established you then type your message, pressing ^D (control-D) to 
end. 

If the receiving computer is running WinPopup the user will 
receive the message and probably a beep. If they are not running 
WinPopup the message will be lost, and no error message will 
occur. 

The message is also automatically truncated if the message 
is over 1600 bytes, as this is the limit of the protocol. 

One useful trick is to cat the message through
\fBsmbclient\fR. For example: \fB cat mymessage.txt | smbclient -M FRED \fR will 
send the message in the file \fImymessage.txt\fR 
to the machine FRED. 

You may also find the \fI-U\fR and 
\fI-I\fR options useful, as they allow you to 
control the FROM and TO parts of the message. 

See the message command parameter in the \fI smb.conf(5)\fR for a description of how to handle incoming 
WinPopup messages in Samba. 

\fBNote\fR: Copy WinPopup into the startup group 
on your WfWg PCs if you want them to always be able to receive 
messages. 
.TP
\fB-i scope\fR
This specifies a NetBIOS scope that smbclient will 
use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names. For details 
on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see \fIrfc1001.txt\fR 
and \fIrfc1002.txt\fR.
NetBIOS scopes are \fBvery\fR rarely used, only set 
this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all 
the NetBIOS systems you communicate with. 
.TP
\fB-N\fR
If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal 
password prompt from the client to the user. This is useful when 
accessing a service that does not require a password. 

Unless a password is specified on the command line or 
this parameter is specified, the client will request a 
password.
.TP
\fB-n NetBIOS name\fR
By default, the client will use the local 
machine's hostname (in uppercase) as its NetBIOS name. This parameter 
allows you to override the host name and use whatever NetBIOS 
name you wish. 
.TP
\fB-d debuglevel\fR
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer from 0 to 10, or 
the letter 'A'. 

The default value if this parameter is not specified 
is zero. 

The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to 
the log files about the activities of the 
client. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will 
be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day to day running - 
it generates a small amount of information about operations 
carried out. 

Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log 
data, and should only be used when investigating a problem.
Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and 
generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely 
cryptic. If \fIdebuglevel\fR is set to the letter 'A', then \fBall
\fRdebug messages will be printed. This setting
is for developers only (and people who \fBreally\fR want 
to know how the code works internally). 

Note that specifying this parameter here will override
the log level parameter in the \fIsmb.conf (5)\fR 
file. 
.TP
\fB-p port\fR
This number is the TCP port number that will be used 
when making connections to the server. The standard (well-known)
TCP port number for an SMB/CIFS server is 139, which is the 
default. 
.TP
\fB-l logfilename\fR
If specified, \fIlogfilename\fR specifies a base filename 
into which operational data from the running client will be 
logged. 

The default base name is specified at compile time.

The base name is used to generate actual log file names.
For example, if the name specified was "log", the debug file 
would be \fIlog.client\fR.

The log file generated is never removed by the client. 
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print the usage message for the client. 
.TP
\fB-I IP-address\fR
\fIIP address\fR is the address of the server to connect to. 
It should be specified in standard "a.b.c.d" notation. 

Normally the client would attempt to locate a named 
SMB/CIFS server by looking it up via the NetBIOS name resolution 
mechanism described above in the \fIname resolve order\fR 
parameter above. Using this parameter will force the client
to assume that the server is on the machine with the specified IP 
address and the NetBIOS name component of the resource being 
connected to will be ignored. 

There is no default for this parameter. If not supplied, 
it will be determined automatically by the client as described 
above. 
.TP
\fB-E\fR
This parameter causes the client to write messages 
to the standard error stream (stderr) rather than to the standard 
output stream. 

By default, the client writes messages to standard output 
- typically the user's tty. 
.TP
\fB-U username[%pass]\fR
Sets the SMB username or username and password. 
If %pass is not specified, The user will be prompted. The client 
will first check the \fBUSER\fR environment variable, then the 
\fBLOGNAME\fR variable and if either exists, the 
string is uppercased. Anything in these variables following a '%' 
sign will be treated as the password. If these environment 
variables are not found, the username GUEST 
is used. 

If the password is not included in these environment
variables (using the %pass syntax), \fBsmbclient\fR will look for 
a \fBPASSWD\fR environment variable from which 
to read the password. 

A third option is to use a credentials file which 
contains the plaintext of the domain name, username and password. This 
option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin doesn't 
wish to pass the credentials on the command line or via environment 
variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions 
on the file restrict access from unwanted users. See the 
\fI-A\fR for more details. 

Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or in 
the \fBPASSWD\fR environment variable. Also, on 
many systems the command line of a running process may be seen 
via the \fBps\fR command to be safe always allow 
\fBsmbclient\fR to prompt for a password and type 
it in directly. 
.TP
\fB-A filename\fR
This option allows 
you to specify a file from which to read the username, domain name, and 
password used in the connection. The format of the file is 

.sp
.nf
username = <value> 
password = <value>
domain = <value>
		
.sp
.fi

If the domain parameter is missing the current workgroup name
is used instead. Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict 
access from unwanted users. 
.TP
\fB-L\fR
This option allows you to look at what services 
are available on a server. You use it as \fBsmbclient -L 
host\fR and a list should appear. The \fI-I
\fRoption may be useful if your NetBIOS names don't 
match your TCP/IP DNS host names or if you are trying to reach a 
host on another network. 
.TP
\fB-t terminal code\fR
This option tells \fBsmbclient\fR how to interpret 
filenames coming from the remote server. Usually Asian language 
multibyte UNIX implementations use different character sets than 
SMB/CIFS servers (\fBEUC\fR instead of \fB SJIS\fR for example). Setting this parameter will let 
\fBsmbclient\fR convert between the UNIX filenames and 
the SMB filenames correctly. This option has not been seriously tested 
and may have some problems. 

The terminal codes include CWsjis, CWeuc, CWjis7, CWjis8,
CWjunet, CWhex, CWcap. This is not a complete list, check the Samba 
source code for the complete list. 
.TP
\fB-b buffersize\fR
This option changes the transmit/send buffer 
size when getting or putting a file from/to the server. The default 
is 65520 bytes. Setting this value smaller (to 1200 bytes) has been 
observed to speed up file transfers to and from a Win9x server. 
.TP
\fB-W WORKGROUP\fR
Override the default workgroup specified in the 
workgroup parameter of the \fIsmb.conf\fR file 
for this connection. This may be needed to connect to some 
servers. 
.TP
\fB-T tar options\fR
smbclient may be used to create \fBtar(1)
\fRcompatible backups of all the files on an SMB/CIFS
share. The secondary tar flags that can be given to this option 
are : 
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIc\fR - Create a tar file on UNIX. 
Must be followed by the name of a tar file, tape device
or "-" for standard output. If using standard output you must 
turn the log level to its lowest value -d0 to avoid corrupting 
your tar file. This flag is mutually exclusive with the 
\fIx\fR flag. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIx\fR - Extract (restore) a local 
tar file back to a share. Unless the -D option is given, the tar 
files will be restored from the top level of the share. Must be 
followed by the name of the tar file, device or "-" for standard 
input. Mutually exclusive with the \fIc\fR flag. 
Restored files have their creation times (mtime) set to the
date saved in the tar file. Directories currently do not get 
their creation dates restored properly. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fII\fR - Include files and directories. 
Is the default behavior when filenames are specified above. Causes 
tar files to be included in an extract or create (and therefore 
everything else to be excluded). See example below. Filename globbing 
works in one of two ways. See r below. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIX\fR - Exclude files and directories. 
Causes tar files to be excluded from an extract or create. See 
example below. Filename globbing works in one of two ways now. 
See \fIr\fR below. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIb\fR - Blocksize. Must be followed 
by a valid (greater than zero) blocksize. Causes tar file to be 
written out in blocksize*TBLOCK (usually 512 byte) blocks. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIg\fR - Incremental. Only back up 
files that have the archive bit set. Useful only with the 
\fIc\fR flag. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIq\fR - Quiet. Keeps tar from printing 
diagnostics as it works. This is the same as tarmode quiet. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIr\fR - Regular expression include
or exclude. Uses regular expression matching for 
excluding or excluding files if compiled with HAVE_REGEX_H. 
However this mode can be very slow. If not compiled with 
HAVE_REGEX_H, does a limited wildcard match on '*' and '?'. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIN\fR - Newer than. Must be followed 
by the name of a file whose date is compared against files found 
on the share during a create. Only files newer than the file 
specified are backed up to the tar file. Useful only with the 
\fIc\fR flag. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIa\fR - Set archive bit. Causes the 
archive bit to be reset when a file is backed up. Useful with the 
\fIg\fR and \fIc\fR flags. 
.RE
.PP
\fBTar Long File Names\fR
.PP
.PP
\fBsmbclient\fR's tar option now supports long 
file names both on backup and restore. However, the full path 
name of the file must be less than 1024 bytes. Also, when
a tar archive is created, \fBsmbclient\fR's tar option places all 
files in the archive with relative names, not absolute names. 
.PP
.PP
\fBTar Filenames\fR
.PP
.PP
All file names can be given as DOS path names (with '\\' 
as the component separator) or as UNIX path names (with '/' as 
the component separator). 
.PP
.PP
\fBExamples\fR
.PP
.PP
Restore from tar file \fIbackup.tar\fR into myshare on mypc 
(no password on share). 
.PP
.PP
\fBsmbclient //mypc/yshare "" -N -Tx backup.tar
\fR.PP
.PP
Restore everything except \fIusers/docs\fR
.PP
.PP
\fBsmbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -TXx backup.tar 
users/docs\fR
.PP
.PP
Create a tar file of the files beneath \fI users/docs\fR. 
.PP
.PP
\fBsmbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -Tc
backup.tar users/docs \fR
.PP
.PP
Create the same tar file as above, but now use 
a DOS path name. 
.PP
.PP
\fBsmbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -tc backup.tar 
users\\edocs \fR
.PP
.PP
Create a tar file of all the files and directories in 
the share. 
.PP
.PP
\fBsmbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -Tc backup.tar *
\fR.PP
.TP
\fB-D initial directory\fR
Change to initial directory before starting. Probably 
only of any use with the tar -T option. 
.TP
\fB-c command string\fR
command string is a semicolon-separated list of 
commands to be executed instead of prompting from stdin. \fI -N\fR is implied by \fI-c\fR.

This is particularly useful in scripts and for printing stdin 
to the server, e.g. \fB-c 'print -'\fR. 
.SH "OPERATIONS"
.PP
Once the client is running, the user is presented with 
a prompt : 
.PP
smb:\\> 
.PP
The backslash ("\\") indicates the current working directory 
on the server, and will change if the current working directory 
is changed. 
.PP
The prompt indicates that the client is ready and waiting to 
carry out a user command. Each command is a single word, optionally 
followed by parameters specific to that command. Command and parameters 
are space-delimited unless these notes specifically
state otherwise. All commands are case-insensitive. Parameters to 
commands may or may not be case sensitive, depending on the command. 
.PP
You can specify file names which have spaces in them by quoting 
the name with double quotes, for example "a long file name". 
.PP
Parameters shown in square brackets (e.g., "[parameter]") are 
optional. If not given, the command will use suitable defaults. Parameters 
shown in angle brackets (e.g., "<parameter>") are required.
.PP
Note that all commands operating on the server are actually 
performed by issuing a request to the server. Thus the behavior may 
vary from server to server, depending on how the server was implemented. 
.PP
The commands available are given here in alphabetical order. 
.TP
\fB? [command]\fR
If \fIcommand\fR is specified, the ? command will display 
a brief informative message about the specified command. If no 
command is specified, a list of available commands will
be displayed. 
.TP
\fB! [shell command]\fR
If \fIshell command\fR is specified, the ! 
command will execute a shell locally and run the specified shell 
command. If no command is specified, a local shell will be run. 
.TP
\fBcd [directory name]\fR
If "directory name" is specified, the current 
working directory on the server will be changed to the directory 
specified. This operation will fail if for any reason the specified 
directory is inaccessible. 

If no directory name is specified, the current working 
directory on the server will be reported. 
.TP
\fBdel <mask>\fR
The client will request that the server attempt 
to delete all files matching \fImask\fR from the current working 
directory on the server. 
.TP
\fBdir <mask>\fR
A list of the files matching \fImask\fR in the current 
working directory on the server will be retrieved from the server 
and displayed. 
.TP
\fBexit\fR
Terminate the connection with the server and exit 
from the program. 
.TP
\fBget <remote file name> [local file name]\fR
Copy the file called \fIremote file name\fR from 
the server to the machine running the client. If specified, name 
the local copy \fIlocal file name\fR. Note that all transfers in 
\fBsmbclient\fR are binary. See also the 
lowercase command. 
.TP
\fBhelp [command]\fR
See the ? command above. 
.TP
\fBlcd [directory name]\fR
If \fIdirectory name\fR is specified, the current 
working directory on the local machine will be changed to 
the directory specified. This operation will fail if for any 
reason the specified directory is inaccessible. 

If no directory name is specified, the name of the 
current working directory on the local machine will be reported. 
.TP
\fBlowercase\fR
Toggle lowercasing of filenames for the get and 
mget commands. 

When lowercasing is toggled ON, local filenames are converted 
to lowercase when using the get and mget commands. This is
often useful when copying (say) MSDOS files from a server, because 
lowercase filenames are the norm on UNIX systems. 
.TP
\fBls <mask>\fR
See the dir command above. 
.TP
\fBmask <mask>\fR
This command allows the user to set up a mask 
which will be used during recursive operation of the mget and 
mput commands. 

The masks specified to the mget and mput commands act as 
filters for directories rather than files when recursion is 
toggled ON. 

The mask specified with the mask command is necessary 
to filter files within those directories. For example, if the
mask specified in an mget command is "source*" and the mask 
specified with the mask command is "*.c" and recursion is 
toggled ON, the mget command will retrieve all files matching 
"*.c" in all directories below and including all directories 
matching "source*" in the current working directory. 

Note that the value for mask defaults to blank (equivalent 
to "*") and remains so until the mask command is used to change it. 
It retains the most recently specified value indefinitely. To 
avoid unexpected results it would be wise to change the value of 
mask back to "*" after using the mget or mput commands. 
.TP
\fBmd <directory name>\fR
See the mkdir command. 
.TP
\fBmget <mask>\fR
Copy all files matching \fImask\fR from the server to 
the machine running the client. 

Note that \fImask\fR is interpreted differently during recursive 
operation and non-recursive operation - refer to the recurse and 
mask commands for more information. Note that all transfers in 
\fBsmbclient\fR are binary. See also the lowercase command. 
.TP
\fBmkdir <directory name>\fR
Create a new directory on the server (user access 
privileges permitting) with the specified name. 
.TP
\fBmput <mask>\fR
Copy all files matching \fImask\fR in the current working 
directory on the local machine to the current working directory on 
the server. 

Note that \fImask\fR is interpreted differently during recursive 
operation and non-recursive operation - refer to the recurse and mask 
commands for more information. Note that all transfers in \fBsmbclient\fR 
are binary. 
.TP
\fBprint <file name>\fR
Print the specified file from the local machine 
through a printable service on the server. 

See also the printmode command.
.TP
\fBprintmode <graphics or text>\fR
Set the print mode to suit either binary data 
(such as graphical information) or text. Subsequent print
commands will use the currently set print mode. 
.TP
\fBprompt\fR
Toggle prompting for filenames during operation 
of the mget and mput commands. 

When toggled ON, the user will be prompted to confirm 
the transfer of each file during these commands. When toggled 
OFF, all specified files will be transferred without prompting. 
.TP
\fBput <local file name> [remote file name]\fR
Copy the file called \fIlocal file name\fR from the 
machine running the client to the server. If specified,
name the remote copy \fIremote file name\fR. Note that all transfers 
in \fBsmbclient\fR are binary. See also the lowercase command. 
.TP
\fBqueue\fR
Displays the print queue, showing the job id, 
name, size and current status. 
.TP
\fBquit\fR
See the exit command. 
.TP
\fBrd <directory name>\fR
See the rmdir command. 
.TP
\fBrecurse\fR
Toggle directory recursion for the commands mget 
and mput. 

When toggled ON, these commands will process all directories 
in the source directory (i.e., the directory they are copying
from ) and will recurse into any that match the mask specified 
to the command. Only files that match the mask specified using 
the mask command will be retrieved. See also the mask command. 

When recursion is toggled OFF, only files from the current 
working directory on the source machine that match the mask specified 
to the mget or mput commands will be copied, and any mask specified 
using the mask command will be ignored. 
.TP
\fBrm <mask>\fR
Remove all files matching \fImask\fR from the current 
working directory on the server. 
.TP
\fBrmdir <directory name>\fR
Remove the specified directory (user access 
privileges permitting) from the server. 
.TP
\fBtar <c|x>[IXbgNa]\fR
Performs a tar operation - see the \fI-T
\fRcommand line option above. Behavior may be affected 
by the tarmode command (see below). Using g (incremental) and N 
(newer) will affect tarmode settings. Note that using the "-" option 
with tar x may not work - use the command line option instead. 
.TP
\fBblocksize <blocksize>\fR
Blocksize. Must be followed by a valid (greater 
than zero) blocksize. Causes tar file to be written out in 
\fIblocksize\fR*TBLOCK (usually 512 byte) blocks. 
.TP
\fBtarmode <full|inc|reset|noreset>\fR
Changes tar's behavior with regard to archive 
bits. In full mode, tar will back up everything regardless of the 
archive bit setting (this is the default mode). In incremental mode, 
tar will only back up files with the archive bit set. In reset mode, 
tar will reset the archive bit on all files it backs up (implies 
read/write share). 
.TP
\fBsetmode <filename> <perm=[+|\\-]rsha>\fR
A version of the DOS attrib command to set 
file permissions. For example: 

\fBsetmode myfile +r \fR

would make myfile read only. 
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Some servers are fussy about the case of supplied usernames, 
passwords, share names (AKA service names) and machine names. 
If you fail to connect try giving all parameters in uppercase. 
.PP
It is often necessary to use the -n option when connecting 
to some types of servers. For example OS/2 LanManager insists 
on a valid NetBIOS name being used, so you need to supply a valid 
name that would be known to the server.
.PP
smbclient supports long file names where the server 
supports the LANMAN2 protocol or above.

The variable \fBUSER\fR may contain the 
username of the person using the client. This information is 
used only if the protocol level is high enough to support 
session-level passwords.
.PP
The variable \fBPASSWD\fR may contain 
the password of the person using the client. This information is 
used only if the protocol level is high enough to support 
session-level passwords. 
.PP
The variable \fBLIBSMB_PROG\fR may contain 
the path, executed with system(), which the client should connect 
to instead of connecting to a server. This functionality is primarily
intended as a development aid, and works best when using a LMHOSTS 
file
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.PP
The location of the client program is a matter for 
individual system administrators. The following are thus
suggestions only. 
.PP
It is recommended that the smbclient software be installed
in the \fI/usr/local/samba/bin/\fR or \fI /usr/samba/bin/\fR directory, this directory readable 
by all, writeable only by root. The client program itself should 
be executable by all. The client should \fBNOT\fR be 
setuid or setgid! 
.PP
The client log files should be put in a directory readable 
and writeable only by the user. 
.PP
To test the client, you will need to know the name of a 
running SMB/CIFS server. It is possible to run \fBsmbd(8)
\fRas an ordinary user - running that server as a daemon 
on a user-accessible port (typically any port number over 1024)
would provide a suitable test server. 
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
Most diagnostics issued by the client are logged in a 
specified log file. The log file name is specified at compile time, 
but may be overridden on the command line. 
.PP
The number and nature of diagnostics available depends 
on the debug level used by the client. If you have problems, 
set the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files. 
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
