.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite\&.

.PP
\fBsmbcontrol\fR is a very small program, which sends messages to a \fBsmbd\fR(8), a \fBnmbd\fR(8), or a \fBwinbindd\fR(8) daemon running on the system\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
-h|--help
Print a summary of command line options\&.


.TP
-s <configuration file>
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See \fIsmb\&.conf\fR for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.


.TP
-i
Run interactively\&. Individual commands of the form destination message-type parameters can be entered on STDIN\&. An empty command line or a "q" will quit the program\&.


.TP
destination
One of \fInmbd\fR, \fIsmbd\fR or a process ID\&.


The \fIsmbd\fR destination causes the message to "broadcast" to all smbd daemons\&.


The \fInmbd\fR destination causes the message to be sent to the nmbd daemon specified in the \fInmbd\&.pid\fR file\&.


If a single process ID is given, the message is sent to only that process\&.


.TP
message-type
Type of message to send\&. See the section \fBMESSAGE-TYPES\fR for details\&.


.TP
parameters
any parameters required for the message-type


.SH "MESSAGE-TYPES"

.PP
Available message types are:

.TP
close-share
Order smbd to close the client connections to the named share\&. Note that this doesn't affect client connections to any other shares\&. This message-type takes an argument of the share name for which client connections will be closed, or the "*" character which will close all currently open shares\&. This may be useful if you made changes to the access controls on the share\&. This message can only be sent to \fBsmbd\fR\&.


.TP
debug
Set debug level to the value specified by the parameter\&. This can be sent to any of the destinations\&.


.TP
force-election
This message causes the \fBnmbd\fR daemon to force a new browse master election\&.


.TP
ping
Send specified number of "ping" messages and wait for the same number of reply "pong" messages\&. This can be sent to any of the destinations\&.


.TP
profile
Change profile settings of a daemon, based on the parameter\&. The parameter can be "on" to turn on profile stats collection, "off" to turn off profile stats collection, "count" to enable only collection of count stats (time stats are disabled), and "flush" to zero the current profile stats\&. This can be sent to any smbd or nmbd destinations\&.


.TP
debuglevel
Request debuglevel of a certain daemon and write it to stdout\&. This can be sent to any of the destinations\&.


.TP
profilelevel
Request profilelevel of a certain daemon and write it to stdout\&. This can be sent to any smbd or nmbd destinations\&.


.TP
printnotify
Order smbd to send a printer notify message to any Windows NT clients connected to a printer\&. This message-type takes the following arguments:



.RS

.TP
queuepause printername
Send a queue pause change notify message to the printer specified\&.


.TP
queueresume printername
Send a queue resume change notify message for the printer specified\&.


.TP
jobpause printername unixjobid
Send a job pause change notify message for the printer and unix jobid specified\&.


.TP
jobresume printername unixjobid
Send a job resume change notify message for the printer and unix jobid specified\&.


.TP
jobdelete printername unixjobid
Send a job delete change notify message for the printer and unix jobid specified\&.


.RE
Note that this message only sends notification that an event has occured\&. It doesn't actually cause the event to happen\&.


This message can only be sent to \fBsmbd\fR\&.


.TP
samsync
Order smbd to synchronise sam database from PDC (being BDC)\&. Can only be sent to \fBsmbd\fR\&.

Not working at the moment


.TP
samrepl
Send sam replication message, with specified serial\&. Can only be sent to \fBsmbd\fR\&. Should not be used manually\&.


.TP
dmalloc-mark
Set a mark for dmalloc\&. Can be sent to both smbd and nmbd\&. Only available if samba is built with dmalloc support\&.


.TP
dmalloc-log-changed
Dump the pointers that have changed since the mark set by dmalloc-mark\&. Can be sent to both smbd and nmbd\&. Only available if samba is built with dmalloc support\&.


.TP
shutdown
Shut down specified daemon\&. Can be sent to both smbd and nmbd\&.


.TP
pool-usage
Print a human-readable description of all talloc(pool) memory usage by the specified daemon/process\&. Available for both smbd and nmbd\&.


.TP
drvupgrade
Force clients of printers using specified driver to update their local version of the driver\&. Can only be sent to smbd\&.


.TP
reload-config
Force daemon to reload smb\&.conf configuration file\&. Can be sent to \fBsmbd\fR, \fBnmbd\fR, or \fBwinbindd\fR\&.


.SH "VERSION"

.PP
This man page is correct for version 3\&.0 of the Samba suite\&.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.PP
\fBnmbd\fR(8) and \fBsmbd\fR(8)\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.

.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
