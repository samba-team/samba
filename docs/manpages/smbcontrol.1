.SH NAME
smbcontrol \- send messages to smbd, nmbd or winbindd processes
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsmbcontrol\fR [ \fB-i\fR ] [ \fB-s\fR ]


\fBsmbcontrol\fR [ \fBdestination\fR ] [ \fBmessage-type\fR ] [ \fBparameter\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite.
.PP
\fBsmbcontrol\fR is a very small program, which 
sends messages to a \fBsmbd\fR(8), a \fBnmbd\fR(8), or a \fBwinbindd\fR(8) daemon running on the system.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-h|--help\fR
Print a summary of command line options.
.TP
\fB-s <configuration file>\fR
The file specified contains the 
configuration details required by the server.  The 
information in this file includes server-specific
information such as what printcap file to use, as well 
as descriptions of all the services that the server is 
to provide. See \fIsmb.conf(5)\fR for more information.
The default configuration file name is determined at 
compile time.
.TP
\fB-i\fR
Run interactively. Individual commands 
of the form destination message-type parameters can be entered 
on STDIN. An empty command line or a "q" will quit the 
program.
.TP
\fBdestination\fR
One of \fInmbd\fR, \fIsmbd\fR or a process ID.

The \fIsmbd\fR destination causes the 
message to "broadcast" to all smbd daemons.

The \fInmbd\fR destination causes the 
message to be sent to the nmbd daemon specified in the 
\fInmbd.pid\fR file.

If a single process ID is given, the message is sent 
to only that process.
.TP
\fBmessage-type\fR
Type of message to send. See 
the section MESSAGE-TYPES for details.
.TP
\fBparameters\fR
any parameters required for the message-type
.SH "MESSAGE-TYPES"
.PP
Available message types are:
.TP
\fBclose-share\fR
Order smbd to close the client 
connections to the named share. Note that this doesn't affect client 
connections to any other shares. This message-type takes an argument of the
share name for which client connections will be closed, or the
"*" character which will close all currently open shares.
This may be useful if you made changes to the access controls on the share.
This message can only be sent to smbd.
.TP
\fBdebug\fR
Set debug level to the value specified by the 
parameter. This can be sent to any of the destinations.
.TP
\fBforce-election\fR
This message causes the \fBnmbd\fR daemon to 
force a new browse master election. 
.TP
\fBping\fR
Send specified number of "ping" messages and 
wait for the same number of  reply "pong" messages. This can be sent to 
any of the destinations.
.TP
\fBprofile\fR
Change profile settings of a daemon, based on the 
parameter. The parameter can be "on" to turn on profile stats 
collection, "off" to turn off profile stats collection, "count"
to enable only collection of count stats (time stats are 
disabled), and "flush" to zero the current profile stats. This can 
be sent to any smbd or nmbd destinations.
.TP
\fBdebuglevel\fR
Request debuglevel of a certain daemon and write it to stdout. This 
can be sent to any of the destinations.
.TP
\fBprofilelevel\fR
Request profilelevel of a certain daemon and write it to stdout. 
This can be sent to any smbd or nmbd destinations.
.TP
\fBprintnotify\fR
Order smbd to send a printer notify message to any Windows NT clients 
connected to a printer. This message-type takes the following arguments:
.RS
.TP
\fBqueuepause printername\fR
Send a queue pause change notify
message to the printer specified.
.TP
\fBqueueresume printername\fR
Send a queue resume change notify
message for the printer specified.
.TP
\fBjobpause printername unixjobid\fR
Send a job pause change notify
message for the printer and unix jobid
specified.
.TP
\fBjobresume printername unixjobid\fR
Send a job resume change notify
message for the printer and unix jobid

.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3.0 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBnmbd\fR(8) and \fBsmbd\fR(8).
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at  ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison.  The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for
Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
