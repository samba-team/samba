\fBsmbmnt\fR is a helper application used 
by the smbmount program to do the actual mounting of SMB shares. 
\fBsmbmnt\fR is meant to be installed setuid root 
so that normal users can mount their SMB shares. It checks 
whether the user has write permissions on the mount point and 
then mounts the directory.
