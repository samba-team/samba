\fBsmbmnt\fR \fBmount-point\fR [ \fB-s <share>\fR ]  [ \fB-r\fR ]  [ \fB-u <uid>\fR ]  [ \fB-g <gid>\fR ]  [ \fB-f <mask>\fR ]  [ \fB-d <mask>\fR ]  [ \fB-o <options>\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsmbmnt\fR is a helper application used 
by the smbmount program to do the actual mounting of SMB shares. 
\fBsmbmnt\fR can be installed setuid root if you want
normal users to be able to mount their SMB shares.
.PP
A setuid smbmnt will only allow mounts on directories owned
by the user, and that the user has write permission on.
.PP
The \fBsmbmnt\fR program is normally invoked 
by \fBsmbmount(8)\fR
. It should not be invoked directly by users.

smbmount searches the normal PATH for smbmnt. You must ensure
that the smbmnt version in your path matches the smbmount used.
