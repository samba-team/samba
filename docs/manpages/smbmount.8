.TH "SMBMOUNT" "8" "06 December 2001" "" ""
.SH NAME
smbmount \- mount an smbfs filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBsmbumount\fR \fBservice\fR \fBmount-point\fR [ \fB-o options\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsmbmount\fR mounts a Linux SMB filesystem. It 
is usually invoked as \fBmount.smbfs\fR by
the \fBmount(8)\fR command when using the 
"-t smbfs" option. This command only works in Linux, and the kernel must
support the smbfs filesystem. 
.PP
Options to \fBsmbmount\fR are specified as a comma-separated
list of key=value pairs. It is possible to send options other
than those listed here, assuming that smbfs supports them. If
you get mount failures, check your kernel log for errors on
unknown options.
.PP
\fBsmbmount\fR is a daemon. After mounting it keeps running until
the mounted smbfs is umounted. It will log things that happen
when in daemon mode using the "machine name" smbmount, so
typically this output will end up in \fIlog.smbmount\fR. The
\fBsmbmount\fR process may also be called mount.smbfs.
.PP
\fBNOTE:\fR \fBsmbmount\fR 
calls \fBsmbmnt(8)\fR to do the actual mount. You 
must make sure that \fBsmbmnt\fR is in the path so 
that it can be found. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBusername=<arg>\fR
specifies the username to connect as. If
this is not given, then the environment variable \fB USER\fR is used. This option can also take the
form "user%password" or "user/workgroup" or
"user/workgroup%password" to allow the password and workgroup
to be specified as part of the username.
.TP
\fBpassword=<arg>\fR
specifies the SMB password. If this
option is not given then the environment variable
\fBPASSWD\fR is used. If it can find
no password \fBsmbmount\fR will prompt
for a passeword, unless the guest option is
given. 

Note that password which contain the arguement delimiter
character (i.e. a comma ',') will failed to be parsed correctly
on the command line. However, the same password defined
in the PASSWD environment variable or a credentials file (see
below) will be read correctly.
.TP
\fBcredentials=<filename>\fR
specifies a file that contains a username
and/or password. The format of the file is:

.sp
.nf
		username = <value>
		password = <value>
		
.sp
.fi

This is preferred over having passwords in plaintext in a
shared file, such as \fI/etc/fstab\fR. Be sure to protect any
credentials file properly.
.TP
\fBnetbiosname=<arg>\fR
sets the source NetBIOS name. It defaults 
to the local hostname. 
.TP
\fBuid=<arg>\fR
sets the uid that will own all files on
the mounted filesystem.
It may be specified as either a username or a numeric uid.
.TP
\fBgid=<arg>\fR
sets the gid that will own all files on
the mounted filesystem.
It may be specified as either a groupname or a numeric 
gid. 
.TP
\fBport=<arg>\fR
sets the remote SMB port number. The default 
is 139. 
.TP
\fBfmask=<arg>\fR
sets the file mask. This determines the 
permissions that remote files have in the local filesystem. 
The default is based on the current umask. 
.TP
\fBdmask=<arg>\fR
sets the directory mask. This determines the 
permissions that remote directories have in the local filesystem. 
The default is based on the current umask. 
.TP
\fBdebug=<arg>\fR
sets the debug level. This is useful for 
tracking down SMB connection problems. A suggested value to
start with is 4. If set too high there will be a lot of
output, possibly hiding the useful output.
.TP
\fBip=<arg>\fR
sets the destination host or IP address.
.TP
\fBworkgroup=<arg>\fR
sets the workgroup on the destination 
.TP
\fBsockopt=<arg>\fR
sets the TCP socket options. See the \fIsmb.conf
\fR\fIsocket options\fR option.
.TP
\fBscope=<arg>\fR
sets the NetBIOS scope 
.TP
\fBguest\fR
don't prompt for a password 
.TP
\fBro\fR
mount read-only 
.TP
\fBrw\fR
mount read-write 
.TP
\fBiocharset=<arg>\fR
sets the charset used by the Linux side for codepage
to charset translations (NLS). Argument should be the
name of a charset, like iso8859-1. (Note: only kernel
2.4.0 or later)
.TP
\fBcodepage=<arg>\fR
sets the codepage the server uses. See the iocharset
option. Example value cp850. (Note: only kernel 2.4.0
or later)
.TP
\fBttl=<arg>\fR
how long a directory listing is cached in milliseconds
(also affects visibility of file size and date
changes). A higher value means that changes on the
server take longer to be noticed but it can give
better performance on large directories, especially
over long distances. Default is 1000ms but something
like 10000ms (10 seconds) is probably more reasonable
in many cases.
(Note: only kernel 2.4.2 or later)
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
The variable \fBUSER\fR may contain the username of the
person using the client. This information is used only if the
protocol level is high enough to support session-level
passwords. The variable can be used to set both username and
password by using the format username%password.
.PP
The variable \fBPASSWD\fR may contain the password of the
person using the client. This information is used only if the
protocol level is high enough to support session-level
passwords.
.PP
The variable \fBPASSWD_FILE\fR may contain the pathname
of a file to read the password from. A single line of input is
read and used as the password.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Passwords and other options containing , can not be handled.
For passwords an alternative way of passing them is in a credentials
file or in the PASSWD environment.
.PP
The credentials file does not handle usernames or passwords with
leading space.
.PP
One smbfs bug is important enough to mention here, even if it
is a bit misplaced:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Mounts sometimes stop working. This is usually
caused by smbmount terminating. Since smbfs needs smbmount to
reconnect when the server disconnects, the mount will eventually go
dead. An umount/mount normally fixes this. At least 2 ways to
trigger this bug are known.
.PP
Note that the typical response to a bug report is suggestion
to try the latest version first. So please try doing that first,
and always include which versions you use of relevant software
when reporting bugs (minimum: samba, kernel, distribution)
.PP
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
Documentation/filesystems/smbfs.txt in the linux kernel
source tree may contain additional options and information.
.PP
FreeBSD also has a smbfs, but it is not related to smbmount
.PP
For Solaris, HP-UX and others you may want to look at
\fBsmbsh(1)\fRor at other
solutions, such as sharity or perhaps replacing the SMB server with
a NFS server.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
Volker Lendecke, Andrew Tridgell, Michael H. Warfield 
and others.

The current maintainer of smbfs and the userspace
tools \fBsmbmount\fR, \fBsmbumount\fR,
and \fBsmbmnt\fR is Urban Widmark <URL:mailto:urban@teststation.com>.
The SAMBA Mailing list <URL:mailto:samba@samba.org>
is the preferred place to ask questions regarding these programs.
