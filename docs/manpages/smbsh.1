.SH NAME
smbsh \- Allows access to remote SMB shares using UNIX commands
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
\fBsmbsh\fR [-W workgroup] [-U username] [-P prefix] [-R <name resolve order>] [-d <debug level>] [-l logfile] [-L libdir]
     
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite\&.

.PP
\fBsmbsh\fR allows you to access an NT filesystem using UNIX commands such as \fBls\fR, \fB egrep\fR, and \fBrcp\fR\&. You must use a shell that is dynamically linked in order for \fBsmbsh\fR to work correctly\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
-W WORKGROUP
Override the default workgroup specified in the workgroup parameter of the \fBsmb.conf\fR(5) file for this session\&. This may be needed to connect to some servers\&.


.TP
-U username[%pass]
Sets the SMB username or username and password\&. If this option is not specified, the user will be prompted for both the username and the password\&. If %pass is not specified, the user will be prompted for the password\&.


.TP
-P prefix
This option allows the user to set the directory prefix for SMB access\&. The default value if this option is not specified is \fBsmb\fR\&.


.TP
-s <configuration file>
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See \fIsmb\&.conf\fR for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.


.TP
-d|--debug=debuglevel
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer from 0 to 10\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero\&.


The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\&. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day to day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\&.


Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.


Note that specifying this parameter here will override the \fIlog level\fR parameter in the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR file\&.


.TP
-R <name resolve order>
This option is used to determine what naming services and in what order to resolve host names to IP addresses\&. The option takes a space-separated string of different name resolution options\&.


The options are: "lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast"\&. They cause names to be resolved as follows :


\fBlmhosts\fR: Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file\&. If the line in lmhosts has no name type attached to the NetBIOS name (see the \fBlmhosts\fR(5) for details) then any name type matches for lookup\&.

\fBhost\fR: Do a standard host name to IP address resolution, using the system \fI/etc/hosts\fR, NIS, or DNS lookups\&. This method of name resolution is operating system dependent, for instance on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled by the \fI/etc/nsswitch\&.conf \fR file)\&. Note that this method is only used if the NetBIOS name type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise it is ignored\&.

\fBwins\fR: Query a name with the IP address listed in the \fIwins server\fR parameter\&. If no WINS server has been specified this method will be ignored\&.

\fBbcast\fR: Do a broadcast on each of the known local interfaces listed in the \fIinterfaces\fR parameter\&. This is the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it depends on the target host being on a locally connected subnet\&.

If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order defined in the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR file parameter (\fIname resolve order\fR) will be used\&.


The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast\&. Without this parameter or any entry in the \fIname resolve order\fR parameter of the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR file, the name resolution methods will be attempted in this order\&.


.TP
-L libdir
This parameter specifies the location of the shared libraries used by \fBsmbsh\fR\&. The default value is specified at compile time\&.


.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP
To use the \fBsmbsh\fR command, execute \fB smbsh\fR from the prompt and enter the username and password that authenticates you to the machine running the Windows NT operating system\&. 
.nf

system% \fBsmbsh\fR
Username: \fBuser\fR
Password: \fBXXXXXXX\fR
.fi


.PP
Any dynamically linked command you execute from this shell will access the \fI/smb\fR directory using the smb protocol\&. For example, the command \fBls /smb \fR will show a list of workgroups\&. The command\fBls /smb/MYGROUP \fR will show all the machines in the workgroup MYGROUP\&. The command\fBls /smb/MYGROUP/<machine-name>\fR will show the share names for that machine\&. You could then, for example, use the \fB cd\fR command to change directories, \fBvi\fR to edit files, and \fBrcp\fR to copy files\&.

.SH "VERSION"

.PP
This man page is correct for version 3\&.0 of the Samba suite\&.

.SH "BUGS"

.PP
\fBsmbsh\fR works by intercepting the standard libc calls with the dynamically loaded versions in \fI smbwrapper\&.o\fR\&. Not all calls have been "wrapped", so some programs may not function correctly under \fBsmbsh \fR\&.

.PP
Programs which are not dynamically linked cannot make use of \fBsmbsh\fR's functionality\&. Most versions of UNIX have a \fBfile\fR command that will describe how a program was linked\&.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.PP
\fBsmbd\fR(8), \fBsmb.conf\fR(5)

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.

.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
