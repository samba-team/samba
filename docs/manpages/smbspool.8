.SH NAME
smbspool \- send print file to an SMB printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBsmbspool\fR [ \fBjob\fR ]  [ \fBuser\fR ]  [ \fBtitle\fR ]  [ \fBcopies\fR ]  [ \fBoptions\fR ]  [ \fBfilename\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
smbspool is a very small print spooling program that 
sends a print file to an SMB printer. The command-line arguments 
are position-dependent for compatibility with the Common UNIX 
Printing System, but you can use smbspool with any printing system 
or from a program or script.
.PP
\fBDEVICE URI\fR
.PP
smbspool specifies the destination using a Uniform Resource 
Identifier ("URI") with a method of "smb". This string can take 
a number of forms:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
smb://server/printer
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
smb://workgroup/server/printer
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
smb://username:password@server/printer
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
smb://username:password@workgroup/server/printer
.PP
smbspool tries to get the URI from argv[0]. If argv[0] 
contains the name of the program then it looks in the \fB DEVICE_URI\fR environment variable.
.PP
.PP
Programs using the \fBexec(2)\fR functions can 
pass the URI in argv[0], while shell scripts must set the 
\fBDEVICE_URI\fR environment variable prior to
running smbspool.
.PP
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The job argument (argv[1]) contains the 
job ID number and is presently not used by smbspool.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The user argument (argv[2]) contains the 
print user's name and is presently not used by smbspool.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The title argument (argv[3]) contains the 
job title string and is passed as the remote file name 
when sending the print job.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The copies argument (argv[4]) contains 
the number of copies to be printed of the named file. If 
no filename is provided than this argument is not used by 
smbspool.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The options argument (argv[5]) contains 
the print options in a single string and is presently 
not used by smbspool.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The filename argument (argv[6]) contains the 
name of the file to print. If this argument is not specified 
then the print file is read from the standard input.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBsmbd(8)\fR, 
and samba(7).
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
\fBsmbspool\fR was written by Michael Sweet 
at Easy Software Products.
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
