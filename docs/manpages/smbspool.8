.SH NAME
smbspool \- send a print file to an SMB printer
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
\fBsmbspool\fR {job} {user} {title} {copies} {options} [filename]
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite\&.

.PP
smbspool is a very small print spooling program that sends a print file to an SMB printer\&. The command-line arguments are position-dependent for compatibility with the Common UNIX Printing System, but you can use smbspool with any printing system or from a program or script\&.

.PP
\fBDEVICE URI\fR

.PP
smbspool specifies the destination using a Uniform Resource Identifier ("URI") with a method of "smb"\&. This string can take a number of forms:

.TP 3
\(bu
smb://server/printer

.TP
\(bu
smb://workgroup/server/printer

.TP
\(bu
smb://username:password@server/printer

.TP
\(bu
smb://username:password@workgroup/server/printer

.LP

.PP
smbspool tries to get the URI from argv[0]\&. If argv[0] contains the name of the program then it looks in the \fB DEVICE_URI\fR environment variable\&.

.PP
Programs using the \fBexec(2)\fR functions can pass the URI in argv[0], while shell scripts must set the\fBDEVICE_URI\fR environment variable prior to running smbspool\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP 3
\(bu
The job argument (argv[1]) contains the job ID number and is presently not used by smbspool\&.

.TP
\(bu
The user argument (argv[2]) contains the print user's name and is presently not used by smbspool\&.

.TP
\(bu
The title argument (argv[3]) contains the job title string and is passed as the remote file name when sending the print job\&.

.TP
\(bu
The copies argument (argv[4]) contains the number of copies to be printed of the named file\&. If no filename is provided then this argument is not used by smbspool\&.

.TP
\(bu
The options argument (argv[5]) contains the print options in a single string and is currently not used by smbspool\&.

.TP
\(bu
The filename argument (argv[6]) contains the name of the file to print\&. If this argument is not specified then the print file is read from the standard input\&.

.SH "VERSION"

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
\fBsmbspool\fR was written by Michael Sweet at Easy Software Products\&.

.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.

.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
