.SH NAME
smbtree \- A text based smb network browser
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
\fBsmbtree\fR [-b] [-D] [-S]
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite\&.

.PP
\fBsmbtree\fR is a smb browser program in text mode\&. It is similar to the "Network Neighborhood" found on Windows computers\&. It prints a tree with all the known domains, the servers in those domains and the shares on the servers\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
-b
Query network nodes by sending requests as broadcasts instead of querying the (domain) master browser\&.


.TP
-D
Only print a list of all the domains known on broadcast or by the master browser


.TP
-S
Only print a list of all the domains and servers responding on broadcast or known by the master browser\&.


.TP
-V
Prints the version number for \fBsmbd\fR\&.


.TP
-s <configuration file>
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See \fIsmb\&.conf\fR for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.


.TP
-d|--debug=debuglevel
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer from 0 to 10\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero\&.


The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\&. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day to day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\&.


Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.


Note that specifying this parameter here will override the \fIlog level\fR parameter in the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR file\&.


.TP
-l|--logfile=logbasename
File name for log/debug files\&. The extension \fB"\&.client"\fR will be appended\&. The log file is never removed by the client\&.


.TP
-N
If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user\&. This is useful when accessing a service that does not require a password\&.


Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will request a password\&.


.TP
-k
Try to authenticate with kerberos\&. Only useful in an Active Directory environment\&.


.TP
-A|--authfile=filename
This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in the connection\&. The format of the file is


.nf

username = <value>
password = <value>
domain   = <value>
.fi


Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users\&.


.TP
-U|--user=username[%password]
Sets the SMB username or username and password\&.


If %password is not specified, the user will be prompted\&. The client will first check the \fBUSER\fR environment variable, then the \fBLOGNAME\fR variable and if either exists, the string is uppercased\&. If these environmental variables are not found, the username \fBGUEST\fR is used\&.


A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and password\&. This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the credentials on the command line or via environment variables\&. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users\&. See the \fI-A\fR for more details\&.


Be cautious about including passwords in scripts\&. Also, on many systems the command line of a running process may be seen via the \fBps\fR command\&. To be safe always allow \fBrpcclient\fR to prompt for a password and type it in directly\&.


.TP
-h|--help
Print a summary of command line options\&.
