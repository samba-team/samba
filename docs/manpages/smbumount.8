.SH NAME
smbumount \- smbfs umount for normal users
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBsmbumount\fR \fBmount-point\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
With this program, normal users can unmount smb-filesystems, 
provided that it is suid root. \fBsmbumount\fR has 
been written to give normal Linux users more control over their 
resources. It is safe to install this program suid root, because only 
the user who has mounted a filesystem is allowed to unmount it again. 
For root it is not necessary to use smbumount. The normal umount 
program works perfectly well, but it would certainly be problematic 
to make umount setuid root.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBmount-point\fR
The directory to unmount.
