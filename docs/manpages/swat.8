.SH NAME
swat \- Samba Web Administration Tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
\fBswat\fR [-s <smb config file>] [-a]
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite\&.

.PP
\fBswat\fR allows a Samba administrator to configure the complex \fBsmb.conf\fR(5) file via a Web browser\&. In addition, a \fBswat\fR configuration page has help links to all the configurable options in the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR file allowing an administrator to easily look up the effects of any change\&.

.PP
\fBswat\fR is run from \fBinetd\fR 

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
-s smb configuration file
The default configuration file path is determined at compile time\&. The file specified contains the configuration details required by the \fBsmbd\fR(8) server\&. This is the file that \fBswat\fR will modify\&. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See \fIsmb\&.conf\fR for more information\&.


.TP
-a
This option disables authentication and puts \fBswat\fR in demo mode\&. In that mode anyone will be able to modify the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR file\&.


\fBWARNING: Do NOT enable this option on a production server\&. \fR


.TP
-V
Prints the version number for \fBsmbd\fR\&.


.TP
-s <configuration file>
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See \fIsmb\&.conf\fR for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.


.TP
-d|--debug=debuglevel
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer from 0 to 10\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero\&.


The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\&. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day to day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\&.


Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.


Note that specifying this parameter here will override the \fIlog level\fR parameter in the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR file\&.


.TP
-l|--logfile=logbasename
File name for log/debug files\&. The extension \fB"\&.client"\fR will be appended\&. The log file is never removed by the client\&.


.TP
-h|--help
Print a summary of command line options\&.


.SH "INSTALLATION"

.PP
Swat is included as binary package with most distributions\&. The package manager in this case takes care of the installation and configuration\&. This section is only for those who have compiled swat from scratch\&.

.PP
After you compile SWAT you need to run \fBmake install \fR to install the \fBswat\fR binary and the various help files and images\&. A default install would put these in:

.TP 3
\(bu
/usr/local/samba/bin/swat

.TP
\(bu
/usr/local/samba/swat/images/*

.TP
\(bu
/usr/local/samba/swat/help/*

.LP

.SS "Inetd Installation"

.PP
You need to edit your \fI/etc/inetd\&.conf \fR and \fI/etc/services\fR to enable SWAT to be launched via \fBinetd\fR\&.

.PP
In \fI/etc/services\fR you need to add a line like this:

.PP
\fBswat 901/tcp\fR

.PP
Note for NIS/YP and LDAP users - you may need to rebuild the NIS service maps rather than alter your local \fI /etc/services\fR file\&.

.PP
the choice of port number isn't really important except that it should be less than 1024 and not currently used (using a number above 1024 presents an obscure security hole depending on the implementation details of your\fBinetd\fR daemon)\&.

.PP
In \fI/etc/inetd\&.conf\fR you should add a line like this:

.PP
\fBswat stream tcp nowait.400 root /usr/local/samba/bin/swat swat\fR

.PP
One you have edited \fI/etc/services\fR and \fI/etc/inetd\&.conf\fR you need to send a HUP signal to inetd\&. To do this use \fBkill -1 PID \fR where PID is the process ID of the inetd daemon\&.

.SH "LAUNCHING"

.PP
To launch SWAT just run your favorite web browser and point it at "http://localhost:901/"\&.

.PP
Note that you can attach to SWAT from any IP connected machine but connecting from a remote machine leaves your connection open to password sniffing as passwords will be sent in the clear over the wire\&.

.SH "FILES"

.TP
\fI/etc/inetd\&.conf\fR
This file must contain suitable startup information for the meta-daemon\&.


.TP
\fI/etc/services\fR
This file must contain a mapping of service name (e\&.g\&., swat) to service port (e\&.g\&., 901) and protocol type (e\&.g\&., tcp)\&.


.TP
\fI/usr/local/samba/lib/smb\&.conf\fR
This is the default location of the \fBsmb.conf\fR(5) server configuration file that swat edits\&. Other common places that systems install this file are \fI /usr/samba/lib/smb\&.conf\fR and \fI/etc/smb\&.conf \fR\&. This file describes all the services the server is to make available to clients\&.


.SH "WARNINGS"

.PP
\fBswat\fR will rewrite your \fBsmb.conf\fR(5) file\&. It will rearrange the entries and delete all comments, \fIinclude=\fR and \fIcopy= \fR options\&. If you have a carefully crafted \fI smb\&.conf\fR then back it up or don't use swat!

.SH "VERSION"

.PP
This man page is correct for version 3\&.0 of the Samba suite\&.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.PP
\fBinetd(5)\fR, \fBsmbd\fR(8), \fBsmb.conf\fR(5)

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.

.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
