.SH NAME
wbinfo \- Query information from winbind daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBwbinfo\fR [ \fB-u\fR ]  [ \fB-g\fR ]  [ \fB-n name\fR ]  [ \fB-s sid\fR ]  [ \fB-U uid\fR ]  [ \fB-G gid\fR ]  [ \fB-S sid\fR ]  [ \fB-Y sid\fR ]  [ \fB-t\fR ]  [ \fB-m\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
The \fBwbinfo\fR program queries and returns information 
created and used by the \fB winbindd(8)\fRdaemon. 
.PP
The \fBwinbindd(8)\fR daemon must be configured 
and running for the \fBwbinfo\fR program to be able 
to return information.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-u\fR
This option will list all users available 
in the Windows NT domain for which the \fBwinbindd(8)
\fRdaemon is operating in. Users in all trusted domains 
will also be listed. Note that this operation does not assign 
user ids to any users that have not already been seen by 
\fBwinbindd(8)\fR.
.TP
\fB-g\fR
This option will list all groups available 
in the Windows NT domain for which the \fBwinbindd(8)
\fRdaemon is operating in. Groups in all trusted domains
will also be listed. Note that this operation does not assign 
group ids to any groups that have not already been seen by
\fBwinbindd(8)\fR. 
.TP
\fB-n name\fR
The \fI-n\fR option 
queries \fBwinbindd(8)\fR for the SID 
associated with the name specified. Domain names can be specified 
before the user name by using the winbind separator character. 
For example CWDOM1/Administrator refers to the Administrator
user in the domain CWDOM1. If no domain is specified then the 
domain used is the one specified in the \fIsmb.conf\fR
\fIworkgroup\fR parameter. 
.TP
\fB-s sid\fR
Use \fI-s\fR to resolve
a SID to a name. This is the inverse of the \fI-n
\fRoption above. SIDs must be specified as ASCII strings 
in the traditional Microsoft format. For example,
S-1-5-21-1455342024-3071081365-2475485837-500. 
.TP
\fB-U uid\fR
Try to convert a UNIX user id to a Windows NT 
SID. If the uid specified does not refer to one within
the winbind uid range then the operation will fail. 
.TP
\fB-G gid\fR
Try to convert a UNIX group id to a Windows 
NT SID. If the gid specified does not refer to one within 
the winbind gid range then the operation will fail. 
.TP
\fB-S sid\fR
Convert a SID to a UNIX user id. If the SID 
does not correspond to a UNIX user mapped by \fB winbindd(8)\fR then the operation will fail. 
.TP
\fB-Y sid\fR
Convert a SID to a UNIX group id. If the SID 
does not correspond to a UNIX group mapped by \fB winbindd(8)\fR then the operation will fail. 
.TP
\fB-t\fR
Verify that the workstation trust account 
created when the Samba server is added to the Windows NT
domain is working. 
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Produce a list of domains trusted by the 
Windows NT server \fBwinbindd(8)\fR contacts 
when resolving names. This list does not include the Windows 
NT domain the server is a Primary Domain Controller for.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.PP
The wbinfo program returns 0 if the operation 
succeeded, or 1 if the operation failed. If the \fBwinbindd(8)
\fRdaemon is not working \fBwbinfo\fR will always return 
failure. 
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBwinbindd(8)\fR

.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
\fBwbinfo\fR and \fBwinbindd\fR
were written by Tim Potter.
.PP
The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done 
by Gerald Carter
