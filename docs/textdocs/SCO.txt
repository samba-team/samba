Subject:	TCP/IP Bug in SCO Unix
============================================================================

There is an annoying TCPIP bug in SCO Unix. This causes corruption when
transferring files with Samba.

Geza Makay (makayg@math.u-szeged.hu) sends this information:

The patch you need is UOD385 Connection Drivers SLS. It is available from
SCO (ftp.sco.com, directory SLS, files uod385a.Z and uod385a.ltr.Z).

You do not need anything else but the above patch. It installs in seconds,
and corrected the Excel problem. We also had some other minor problems (not
only with Samba) that disappeared by installing this patch.
