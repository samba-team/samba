; Configuration Options ***** Watch location in smb.conf for side-effects *****

; Domain Control Options
; specifies Samba to be the Domain Master Browser
;   domain master = yes 
; Use with care only if you have an NT server on your network that has been

; The following two entries demonstrate how to share a directory so that two

; as many users as required.
