Samba4 developer howto
----------------------

tridge@samba.org, December 2004


This is a very basic document on how to setup a simple Samba4
server. This is aimed at developers who are already familiar with
Samba3 and wish to participate in Samba4 development. This is not
aimed at production use of Samba4.


Step 1: download Samba4
-----------------------

There are 2 methods of doing this:

  method 1:  "rsync -avz samba.org::ftp/unpacked/samba4 ."

  method 2:  "svn co svn://svnanon.samba.org/samba/branches/SAMBA_4_0 samba4"

both methods will create a directory called "samba4" in the current
directory. If you don't have rsync or svn then install one of them. 

Note that the above rsync command will give you a checked out svn
repository. So if you also have svn you can update it to the latest
version at some future date using:

  cd samba4
  svn up


Step 2: compile Samba4
----------------------

Run this:

  cd samba4/source
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure.developer -C
  make

If you have gcc 3.4 or newer, then run "make pch" before "make" to
greatly speed up the compile process (about 5x faster).


Step 3: install Samba4
----------------------

Run this as a user who have permission to write to the install
directory (defaults to /usr/local/samba). Use --prefix option to
configure above to change this.
 
  make install


Step 4: provision Samba4
------------------------

The "provision" step sets up a basic user database. 

  cd source
  ./script/provision.pl --realm=YOUR.REALM --domain=YOURDOM --adminpass=SOMEPASSWORD

This will create a file called newsam.ldb. You need to copy this to
sam.ldb in the "private" subdirectory of your install. For example:

  cp newsam.ldb /usr/local/samba/private/sam.ldb


Step 5: Create a simple smb.conf
--------------------------------

You need to create a smb.conf file in the lib/ directory of your
install. The default is /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf. A minimal
smb.conf would be:

  workgroup = YOURDOM

  [test]
	path = /data/test
	read only = no

The workgroup must exactly match the --domain argument you gave to provision.pl


Step 6: starting Samba4
-----------------------

The simplest is to just run "smbd", but as a developer you may find
the following more useful:

   smbd -i -M single -d3

that means "start smbd without messages in stdout, and running a
single process, with level 3 debugging". That mode of operation makes
debugging smbd with gdb particularly easy.

Make sure you put the bin and sbin directories from your new install
in your $PATH. Make sure you run the right version!


Step 7: testing Samba4
----------------------

try these commands:

      smbclient //localhost/test -Uadministrator%SOMEPASSWORD
    or
     ./script/tests/test_posix.sh //localhost/test administrator SOMEPASSWORD


NOTE about filesystem support
-----------------------------

To use the advanced features of Samba4 you need a filesystem that
supports both the "user" and "system" xattr namespaces.

If you run Linux with a 2.6 kernel and ext3 this means you need to
include the option "user_xattr" in your /etc/fstab. For example:

/dev/hda3		/home			ext3    user_xattr     1 1

You also need to compile your kernel with the XATTR and SECURITY
options for your filesystem. For ext3 that means you need:

   CONFIG_EXT3_FS_XATTR=y
   CONFIG_EXT3_FS_SECURITY=y

If you don't have a filesystem with xattr support, then you can
simulate it by using the option:

   posix:eadb = /usr/local/samba/eadb.tdb

that will place all extra file attributes (NT ACLs, DOS EAs, streams
etc), in that tdb. It is not efficient, and doesn't scale well, but at
least it gives you a choice when you don't have a modern filesystem.

Testing your filesystem
-----------------------

To test your filesystem support, install the 'attr' package and run
the following 4 commands as root:

  touch test.txt
  setfattr -n user.test -v test test.txt
  setfattr -n security.test -v test2 test.txt
  getfattr -d test.txt
  getfattr -d system.txt

You should see output like this:

  # file: test.txt
  user.test="test"

  # file: test.txt
  security.test="test2"

If you get any "Operation not supported" errors then it means your
kernel is not configured correctly, or your filesystem is not mounted
with the right options.

If you get any "Operation not permitted" errors then it probably means
you didn't try the test as root.
