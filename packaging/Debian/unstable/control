Description: A LanManager like file and printer server for Unix.
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or Netbios protocol.
 .
 This package contains all the components necessary to turn your
 Debian GNU/Linux box into a powerful file and printer server.
 .
 As of Samba 2.0.6-1, the Samba Debian packages consist of the following:
 .
 samba - A LanManager like file and printer server for Unix.
 samba-common - Samba common files used by both the server and the client.
 smbclient - A LanManager like simple client for Unix.
 swat - Samba Web Administration Tool
 samba-doc - Samba documentation.
 smbfs - Mount and umount commands for the smbfs (kernels 2.0.x and above).

 This package contains some client components of the Samba suite. In
 particular it includes the command line utilities smbclient, smbtar,
 and smbspool. If you want to mount shares exported from Microsoft
 Windows machines or a Samba server you must install the smbfs package.

Description: mount and umount commands for the smbfs (for kernels >= than 2.2.x)
 Smbfs is a filesystem which understands the SMB protocol.
 This is the protocol Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT or
 Lan Manager use to talk to each other. It was inspired by
 samba, the program by Andrew Tridgell that turns any unix
 site into a file server for DOS or Windows clients.
 .
 If you want to use command-line utilites like smbclient, smbtar
 and/or smbspool just need to install the smbclient package.
 .
 Starting with the Debian Samba packages version 2.2.0-1, the old smbfs
 utilities for 2.0.x have been removed. There are no wrapper scripts
 that call a specific smbmount/smbmount depending on the kernel version.
 If you are using a 2.0.x kernel please upgrade or use the latest Samba
 2.0.7 Debian package.

Suggests: samba
Description: pluggable authentication module for SMB password database
 This is a stackable PAM module that allows a system administrator to easily
 migrate to using encrypted passwords for Samba and to keep smb passwords in
 sync with unix passwords.  Unlike other solutions, it does this without
 requiring users to change their existing passwords or login to Samba using
 cleartext passwords.
