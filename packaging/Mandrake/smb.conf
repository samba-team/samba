# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options (perhaps too
# many!) most of which are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) 
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentry and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command "testparm"
# to check that you have not made any basic syntactic errors. 
#
#======================= Global Settings =====================================
[global]

# 1. Server Naming Options:
# workgroup = NT-Domain-Name or Workgroup-Name
   workgroup = MDKGROUP

# netbios name is the name you will see in "Network Neighbourhood",
# but defaults to your hostname
;  netbios name = <name_of_this_server>

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
   server string = Samba Server %v

# Message command is run by samba when a "popup" message is sent to it.
# The example below is for use with LinPopUp:
; message command = /usr/bin/linpopup "%f" "%m" %s; rm %s

# 2. Printing Options:
# CHANGES TO ENABLE PRINTING ON ALL CUPS PRINTERS IN THE NETWORK
# (as cups is now used in linux-mandrake 7.2 by default)
# if you want to automatically load your printer list rather
# than setting them up individually then you'll need this
   printcap name = lpstat
   load printers = yes

# It should not be necessary to spell out the print system type unless
# yours is non-standard. Currently supported print systems include:
# bsd, sysv, plp, lprng, aix, hpux, qnx, cups
   printing = cups

# Samba 2.2 supports the Windows NT-style point-and-print feature. To
# use this, you need to be able to upload print drivers to the samba
# server. The printer admins (or root) may install drivers onto samba.
# Note that this feature uses the print$ share, so you will need to 
# enable it below.
# printer admin = @<group> <user>
;   printer admin = @adm
# This should work well for winbind:
;   printer admin = @"Domain Admins"

# 3. Logging Options:
# this tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

# Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb).
   max log size = 50

# Set the log (verbosity) level (0 <= log level <= 10)
; log level = 3

# 4. Security and Domain Membership Options:
# This option is important for security. It allows you to restrict
# connections to machines which are on your local network. The
# following example restricts access to two C class networks and
# the "loopback" interface. For more examples of the syntax see
# the smb.conf man page. Do not enable this if (tcp/ip) name resolution does
# not work for all the hosts in your network.
;   hosts allow = 192.168.1. 192.168.2. 127.

# Uncomment this if you want a guest account, you must add this to /etc/passwd
# otherwise the user "nobody" is used
;  guest account = pcguest
# Allow users to map to guest:
  map to guest = bad user

# Security mode. Most people will want user level security. See
# security_level.txt for details.
   security = user
# Use password server option only with security = server or security = domain
# When using security = domain, you should use password server = *
;   password server = <NT-Server-Name>
;   password server = *

# Password Level allows matching of _n_ characters of the password for
# all combinations of upper and lower case.
;  password level = 8
;  username level = 8

# You may wish to use password encryption. Please read
# ENCRYPTION.txt, Win95.txt and WinNT.txt in the Samba documentation.
# Do not enable this option unless you have read those documents
# Encrypted passwords are required for any use of samba in a Windows NT domain
# The smbpasswd file is only required by a server doing authentication, thus
# members of a domain do not need one.
  encrypt passwords = yes
  smb passwd file = /etc/samba/smbpasswd

# The following are needed to allow password changing from Windows to
# also update the Linux system password.
# NOTE: Use these with 'encrypt passwords' and 'smb passwd file' above.
# NOTE2: You do NOT need these to allow workstations to change only
#        the encrypted SMB passwords. They allow the Unix password
#        to be kept in sync with the SMB password.
;  unix password sync = Yes
# You either need to setup a passwd program and passwd chat, or
# enable pam password change
;  pam password change = yes
;  passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
;  passwd chat = *New*UNIX*password* %n\n *Re*ype*new*UNIX*password* %n\n \
;*passwd:*all*authentication*tokens*updated*successfully*

# Unix users can map to different SMB User names
;  username map = /etc/samba/smbusers

# Using the following line enables you to customise your configuration
# on a per machine basis. The %m gets replaced with the netbios name
# of the machine that is connecting
;   include = /etc/samba/smb.conf.%m

# Options for using winbind. Winbind allows you to do all account and
# authentication from a Windows or samba domain controller, creating
# accounts on the fly, and maintaining a mapping of Windows RIDs to unix uid's 
# and gid's. winbind uid and winbind gid are the only required parameters.
#
# winbind uid is the range of uid's winbind can use when mapping RIDs to uid's
;  winbind uid = 10000-20000
#
# winbind gid is the range of uid's winbind can use when mapping RIDs to gid's
;  winbind gid = 10000-20000
#
# winbind separator is the character a user must use between their domain
# name and username, defaults to "\"
;  winbind separator = +
#
# winbind use default domain allows you to have winbind return usernames
# in the form user instead of DOMAIN+user for the domain listed in the
# workgroup parameter.
;  winbind use default domain = yes
#
# template homedir determines the home directory for winbind users, with 
# %D expanding to their domain name and %U expanding to their username:
;  template homedir = /home/%D/%U

# When using winbind, you may want to have samba create home directories
# on the fly for authenticated users. Ensure that /etc/pam.d/samba is
# using 'service=system-auth-winbind' in pam_stack modules, and then
# enable obedience of pam restrictions below:
;  obey pam restrictions = yes

#
# template shell determines the shell users authenticated by winbind get
;  template shell = /bin/bash

# 5. Browser Control and Networking Options:
# Most people will find that this option gives better performance.
# See speed.txt and the manual pages for details
   socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192

# Configure Samba to use multiple interfaces
# If you have multiple network interfaces then you must list them
# here. See the man page for details.
;   interfaces = 192.168.12.2/24 192.168.13.2/24 

# Configure remote browse list synchronisation here
#  request announcement to, or browse list sync from:
#       a specific host or from / to a whole subnet (see below)
;   remote browse sync = 192.168.3.25 192.168.5.255
# Cause this host to announce itself to local subnets here
;   remote announce = 192.168.1.255 192.168.2.44

# set local master to no if you don't want Samba to become a master
# browser on your network. Otherwise the normal election rules apply
;   local master = no

# OS Level determines the precedence of this server in master browser
# elections. The default value should be reasonable
;   os level = 33

# Domain Master specifies Samba to be the Domain Master Browser. This
# allows Samba to collate browse lists between subnets. Don't use this
# if you already have a Windows NT domain controller doing this job
;   domain master = yes 

# Preferred Master causes Samba to force a local browser election on startup
# and gives it a slightly higher chance of winning the election
;   preferred master = yes

# 6. Domain Control Options:
# Enable this if you want Samba to be a domain logon server for 
# Windows95 workstations or Primary Domain Controller for WinNT and Win2k
;   domain logons = yes

# if you enable domain logons then you may want a per-machine or
# per user logon script
# run a specific logon batch file per workstation (machine)
;   logon script = %m.bat
# run a specific logon batch file per username
;   logon script = %U.bat

# Where to store roaming profiles for WinNT and Win2k
#        %L substitutes for this servers netbios name, %U is username
#        You must uncomment the [Profiles] share below
;   logon path = \\%L\Profiles\%U

# Where to store roaming profiles for Win9x. Be careful with this as it also
# impacts where Win2k finds it's /HOME share
; logon home = \\%L\%U\.profile


# The add user script is used by a domain member to add local user accounts
# that have been authenticated by the domain controller, or when adding
# users via the Windows NT Tools (ie User Manager for Domains).

# Scripts for file (passwd, smbpasswd) backend:
; add user script = /usr/sbin/useradd -s /bin/false '%u'
; delete user script = /usr/sbin/userdel '%s'
; add user to group script = /usr/bin/gpasswd -a '%u' '%g'
; delete user from group script = /usr/bin/gpasswd -d '%u' '%g'
; set primary group script = /usr/sbin/usermod -g '%g' '%u'
; add group script = /usr/sbin/groupadd %g && getent group '%g'|awk -F: '{print $3}'
; delete group script = /usr/sbin/groupdel '%g'

# Scripts for LDAP backend (assumes nss_ldap is in use on the domain controller,
# and needs configuration in smbldap_conf.pm
; add user script = /usr/share/samba/scripts/smbldap-useradd.pl '%u'
; delete user script = /usr/share/samba/scripts/smbldap-userdel.pl '%u'
; add user to group script = /usr/share/samba/scripts/smbldap-groupmod.pl -m '%u' '%g'
; delete user from group script = /usr/share/samba/scripts/smbldap-groupmod.pl -x '%u' '%g'
; set primary group script = /usr/share/samba/scripts/smbldap-usermod.pl -g '%g' '%u'
; add group script = /usr/share/samba/scripts/smbldap-groupadd.pl '%g' && /usr/share/samba/scripts/smbldap-groupshow.pl %g|awk '/^gidNumber:/ {print $2}'
; delete group script = /usr/share/samba/scripts/smbldap-userdel.pl '%g'


# The add machine script is use by a samba server configured as a domain
# controller to add local machine accounts when adding machines to the domain.
# The script must work from the command line when replacing the macros,
# or the operation will fail. Check that groups exist if forcing a group.
# Script for domain controller for adding machines:
; add machine script = /usr/sbin/useradd -d /dev/null -g machines -c 'Machine Account' -s /bin/false -M %u
# Script for domain controller with LDAP backend for adding machines (please
# configure in /etc/samba/smbldap_conf.pm first):
; add machine script = /usr/share/samba/scripts/smbldap-useradd.pl -w -d /dev/null -g machines -c 'Machine Account' -s /bin/false %u

# Domain groups:
# Domain groups are now configured by using the 'net groupmap' tool

# Samba Password Database configuration:
# Samba now has runtime-configurable password database backends. Multiple
# passdb backends may be used, but users will only be added to the first one
# Default:
; passdb backend = smbpasswd guest
# TDB backen with fallback to smbpasswd and guest
; passdb backend = tdbsam smbpasswd guest
# LDAP with fallback to smbpasswd guest
# Enable SSL by using an ldaps url, or enable tls with 'ldap ssl' below.
; passdb backend = ldapsam:ldaps://ldap.mydomain.com smbpasswd guest
# Use the samba2 LDAP schema:
; passdb backend = ldapsam_compat:ldaps://ldap.mydomain.com smbpasswd guest

# Idmap settings:
# Idmap backend to use:
; idmap backend = ldap:ldap://ldap.mydomain.com

# This is a range of unix user-id's that samba will map non-unix RIDs to,
# such as when using Winbind
; idmap uid = 10000-20000
; idmap gid = 10000-20000
  
# LDAP configuration for Domain Controlling:
# The account (dn) that samba uses to access the LDAP server
# This account needs to have write access to the LDAP tree
# You will need to give samba the password for this dn, by 
# running 'smbpasswd -w mypassword'
; ldap admin dn = cn=root,dc=mydomain,dc=com
; ldap ssl = start_tls
# start_tls should run on 389, but samba defaults incorrectly to 636
; ldap port = 389
; ldap suffix = dc=mydomain,dc=com
# Seperate suffixes are available for machines, users, groups, and idmap, if 
# ldap suffix appears first, it is appended to the specific suffix.
# Example for a unix-ish directory layout:
; ldap machine suffix = ou=Hosts
; ldap user suffix = ou=People
; ldap group suffix = ou=Group
; ldap idmap suffix = ou=Idmap
# Example for AD-ish layout:
; ldap machine suffix = cn=Computers
; ldap user suffix = cn=Users
; ldap group suffix = cn=Groups
; ldap idmap suffix = cn=Idmap


# 7. Name Resolution Options:
# All NetBIOS names must be resolved to IP Addresses
# 'Name Resolve Order' allows the named resolution mechanism to be specified
# the default order is "host lmhosts wins bcast". "host" means use the unix
# system gethostbyname() function call that will use either /etc/hosts OR
# DNS or NIS depending on the settings of /etc/host.config, /etc/nsswitch.conf
# and the /etc/resolv.conf file. "host" therefore is system configuration
# dependant. This parameter is most often of use to prevent DNS lookups
# in order to resolve NetBIOS names to IP Addresses. Use with care!
# The example below excludes use of name resolution for machines that are NOT
# on the local network segment
# - OR - are not deliberately to be known via lmhosts or via WINS.
; name resolve order = wins lmhosts bcast

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable it's WINS Server
;   wins support = yes

# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
#       Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

# WINS Proxy - Tells Samba to answer name resolution queries on
# behalf of a non WINS capable client, for this to work there must be
# at least one  WINS Server on the network. The default is NO.
;   wins proxy = yes

# DNS Proxy - tells Samba whether or not to try to resolve NetBIOS names
# via DNS nslookups. The built-in default for versions 1.9.17 is yes,
# this has been changed in version 1.9.18 to no.
   dns proxy = no 

# 8. File Naming Options:
# Case Preservation can be handy - system default is _no_
# NOTE: These can be set on a per share basis
;  preserve case = no
;  short preserve case = no
# Default case is normally upper case for all DOS files
;  default case = lower
# Be very careful with case sensitivity - it can break things!
;  case sensitive = no

# Enabling internationalization:
# you can match a Windows code page with a UNIX character set.
# Windows: 437 (US), 737 (GREEK), 850 (Latin1 - Western European),
# 852 (Eastern Eu.), 861 (Icelandic), 932 (Cyrillic - Russian),
# 936 (Japanese - Shift-JIS), 936 (Simpl. Chinese), 949 (Korean Hangul),
# 950 (Trad. Chin.).
# UNIX: ISO8859-1 (Western European), ISO8859-2 (Eastern Eu.),
# ISO8859-5 (Russian Cyrillic), KOI8-R (Alt-Russ. Cyril.)
# This is an example for french users:
;   dos charset = 850
;   unix charset = ISO8859-1

#
# A special case is using the CUPS Windows Postscript driver, which allows
# all features available via CUPS on the client, by publishing the ppd file
# and the cups driver by using the 'cupsaddsmb' tool. This requires the
