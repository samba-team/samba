Building the experimental Debian package for Samba 4.0
======================================================
					   By Jelmer Vernooij, 20 May 2004.

Check out the SAMBA_4 branch of the samba-docs SVN repository 
and put the output in the top directory of samba4 (the directory
where source/ and packaging/ can be found).

Now, go to packaging/, and run:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

See the Debian docs for more information about the debian build 
process.
