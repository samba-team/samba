Internet-Draft          GSS-API Naming Extensions               May 2005


1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   As described in [I-D.GSS-NAMING] the GSS-API's naming architecture
   suffers from certain limitations.  This document proposes concrete
   GSS-API extensions as outlined in [I-D.GSS-NAMING].

   A number of extensions to the GSS-API are described herein with the
   goal of making authorization information, and other information that
   can be modelled as "name attributes" available as such to
   applications.  For example, Kerberos V authorization data elements,
   both, in their raw forms as well as mapped to more useful value
   types, can be made available to GSS-API applications through these
   interfaces.

   The model is that GSS names have attributes.  The attributes of a
   name may be authenticated by the credential whence the name comes, or
   may have been set locally on a GSS name for the purpose of
   "asserting" the attribute during credential acquisition or security
   context exchange.  Name attributes' values are network
   representations thereof (e.g., the actual value octets of the
   contents of an X.509 certificate extension, for example) and are
   intended to be useful for constructing portable access control
   facilities.  Applications may often require language- or platform-
   specific data types, rather than network representations of name
   attributes, so a function is provided to obtain objects of such types
   associated with names and name attributes.

3.  Name Attribute Sources and Criticality

   A given GSS name object's name attributes may be authenticated or
   asserted by an associated credential, or it may be mapped or derived
   from another attribute of the same name.

   That a given name's given attribute is 'mapped' means that it was
   obtained through some mapping mechanism applied to another attribute
   of the name that was not, itself, mapped.  For example, such
   attributes as platform-specific internal identifiers may sometimes be
   mapped from other name attributes.

   Name attributes may be "critical," meaning that applications that do
   not understand them MUST reject security contexts where the peer has
   such unknown, critical attributes.

4.  Name Attributes/Values as ACL Subjects

   Some name attributes (e.g., numeric user or group identifiers) may be
   useful as subjects of access control list (ACL) entries, some may not
   (e.g., time of day login restrictions).  The
   GSS_Inquire_name_attribute() function indicates this.

   To facilitate the development of portable applications that make use
   of name attributes to construct and evaluate portable ACLs the GSS-
   API makes name attribute values available in canonical network
   encodings thereof.

   To facilitate the development of platform- or language-specific
   applications that need access to native types of representations of
   name attributes an optional facility is provided,
   GSS_Map_name_to_any().

5.  Mapping Mechanism Facilities to Name Attributes

   [NOTE:  This entire section should probably be split into one or more
   separate Internet-Drafts.  It is here in the -00 of this I-D to help
   readers understand how to mechanism-specific name attributes would be
   accessed through these GSS-API extensions.]

   Kerberos V [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications] and the Simple
   Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism, SPKM [RFC2025], both support the
   concept and encoding of containers of "authorization-data" as
   described in [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications].

   PKIX [RFC3280] supports a number of authorization-data-like features,
   like Extended Key Usage values (EKUs) and certificate extensions.

   The authorization data can be accessed through the GSS-API name
   attributes facility defined herein.

5.1  Kerberos V and SPKM Authorization-Data

   Authorization-data non-container elements asserted in Kerberos V AP-
   REQ Authenticators MUST be mapped into *asserted* GSS-API name
   attributes; if not contained in AD-IF-RELEVANT then they MUST be
   mapped into *critical* GSS-API name attributes.  AD-AND-OR
   authorization-data elements MUST be mapped into a single *critical*
   attribute, (TBD).

   Authorization-data included in Kerberos V Tickets that is not
   contained in AD-KDCIssued (with valid signature) MUST be mapped into
   *asserted* GSS-API name attributes.  Conversely, authorization-data
   elements in Kerberos V Tickets contained by AD-KDCIssued MUST be

Internet-Draft          GSS-API Naming Extensions               May 2005


   mapped into *authenticated* GSS-API name attributes

   As with authorization-data elements in Authenticators, authorization-
   data elements in Tickets not contained in AD-IF-RELEVANT are to be
   mapped to *critical* name attributes, and similarly with AD-AND-OR
   (see above).

   The OIDs for authorization-data elements are to be the authorization-
   data element's 'ad-type' integer ID, relative to the base OID <TBD>
   [NOTE: what about negative ad-type's?  OID arcs are positive
   integers... ad-type is an Int32, so clearly something can be done.]

5.2  Kerberos V Cross-Realm Transit Paths

   [Add text on how to represent/encode/interpret krb5 realm transit
   paths as name attribute values.  And text on PKINIT too...  Basically
   Ticket's 'transited' field should be exposed as an authenticated name
   attribute, with some uncompressed encoding, possibly encompassing
   certificate validation paths of client certs used for PKINIT, with
   criticality determined by the presence of the transit-policy-checked
   flag.]

5.3  PKIX Certificate Extensions

   [NOTE:  In the Kerberos V authorization-data case we can tell when AD
   elements are "authenticated" and when the are asserted, but what
   about x.509 certificate extensions?  Clearly KU, EKUs and
   subjectAltNames are authenticated in that no CA should sign a cert
   with, say, arbitrary subjectAltNames not understood by the CA, but,
   does that also apply to all other x.509 certificate extensions?  The
   answer may depend on actual CA operator practices...  At worst a new
   extension may be needed, like Kerberos V's AD-KDCIssued AD container
   element; at best this text can just say "all cert extensions MUST be
   mapped to authenticated..." below.]

   PKI certificate extensions MAY/SHOULD/MUST (see comment above) be
   mapped to *authenticated* GSS-API name attributes with the _same_
   OIDs, and if they be marked critical in the certificate then they
   MUST be mapped as *critical* GSS-API name attributes.
   SubjectAltNames and EKUs, specifically, MUST be mapped to
   *authenticated* GSS-API name attributes; see below.  Certificate
   extensions MUST be mapped to GSS-API name attributes whose OIDs are
   the same as the extensions'

5.3.1  PKIX EKUs

   Extended Key Usage extensions, specifically, MUST be mapped as
   described above, except that GSS-API name attributes for EKUs MUST

   have NULL values (i.e., zero-length OCTET STRINGs).

   PKI certificate key usages (KUs, but not EKUs), MUST NOT be mapped to
   GSS-API name attributes.

5.3.2  PKIX Certificate Alternative Names

   PKI certificate subjectAltNames MUST be mapped as *authenticated*,
   *non-critical* GSS-API name attributes.

   PKI certificate extensions MUST be mapped to *authenticated* GSS-API
   name attributes with the _same_ OIDs, and if they be marked critical
   in the certificate then they MUST be mapped as *critical* GSS-API
   name attributes.

   Extended Key Usage extensions, specifically, MUST be mapped as
   described above, except that GSS-API name attributes for EKUs MUST
   have NULL values (i.e., zero-length OCTET STRINGs).

5.3.3  Other PKIX Certificate Extensions and Attributes

   [Add text...]

5.4  PKIX Certificate CA Paths and Trust Anchors

   [Add text on how to represent/encode/interpret PKI certificate
   validation CA paths as name attribute values, much as with Kerberos V
   transited paths.]

   o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates a general error.

   This function outputs the value(s) associated with a given GSS name
   object for a given name attribute.

9.1  C-Bindings

   The C-bindings of GSS_Get_name_attribute() requires one function call
   per-attribute value, for multi-valued name attributes.  This is done
   by using a single gss_buffer_t for each value and an input/output
   integer parameter to distinguish initial and subsequent calls and to
   indicate when all values have been obtained.

   The 'more' input/output parameter should point to an integer variable
   whose value, on first call to gss_name_attribute_get() MUST be -1,
   and whose value upon function call return will be non-zero to
   indicate that additional values remain, or zero to indicate that no
   values remain.  The caller should not modify this parameter after the
   initial call.

   Inputs:


   o  name NAME,

   o  critical BOOLEAN,

   o  attr OBJECT IDENTIFIER,

   o  values SET OF OCTET STRING

   Outputs:


   o  major_status INTEGER,

   o  minor_status INTEGER

   Return major_status codes:

   o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates no error.

   o  GSS_S_UNAVAILABLE indicates that the given attribute OID is not
      known or could not be set.

   o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates a general error.


10.1  C-Bindings

   The C-bindings of GSS_Set_name_attribute() requires one function call
   per-attribute value, for multi-valued name attributes -- each call
   adds one value.  To replace an attribute's every value delete the
   attribute's values first with GSS_Delete_name_attribute().

   OM_uint32 gss_set_name_attribute(
     OM_uint32                     *minor_status,
     gss_name_t                    name,
     int                           critical,

   Inputs:


   o  name NAME,

   o  attr OBJECT IDENTIFIER,

   Outputs:


   o  major_status INTEGER,

   o  minor_status INTEGER

   Return major_status codes:

   o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates no error.

12.  GSS_Export_name_composite()

   Inputs:


   o  name NAME

   Outputs:


   o  major_status INTEGER,

   o  minor_status INTEGER,

   o  exp_composite_name OCTET STRING

   Return major_status codes:

   o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates no error.

   o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates a general error.

   This function outputs a token which can be imported with
   GSS_Import_name(), using GSS_C_NT_COMPOSITE_EXPORT as the name type
   and which preserves any name attribute information associated with
   the input name (which GSS_Export_name() may well not).  The token
   format is no specified here as this facility is intended for inter-
   process communication only; however, all such tokens MUST start with
   a two-octet token ID, hex 04 02, in network byte order.

   The OID for GSS_C_NT_COMPOSITE_EXPORT is <TBD>.

   Inputs:


   o  name NAME,

   o  authenticated BOOLEAN, -- if TRUE no data will be output unless it
      is authenticated

   o  type_id OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   Outputs:


   o  major_status INTEGER,

   o  minor_status INTEGER,

   o  output ANY DEFINED BY type_id

   Return major_status codes:

   o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates no error.

   o  GSS_S_UNAVAILABLE indicates that the mapping or conversion could
      not be done.  The minor status code may provide additional
      information.

   o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates a general error.  The minor status code
      may provide additional information.

   Whereas name attribute's values are encoded in some network
   representation applications often require native, language- and/or
   platform-specific data types.  This function provides access to such
   types.

   o  type_id OBJECT IDENTIFIER,

   o  input ANY DEFINED BY type_id

   Outputs:


   o  major_status INTEGER,

   o  minor_status INTEGER,

   Return major_status codes:

   o  GSS_S_COMPLETE indicates no error.

   o  GSS_S_UNAVAILABLE indicates that the mapping or conversion could
      not be done.  The minor status code may provide additional
      information.

   o  GSS_S_FAILURE indicates a general error.  The minor status code
      may provide additional information.

   This function releases, if possible, the objects of language- and/or
   platform-specific types output by GSS_Map_name_to_any().  If such
   types have native release functions applications MAY use either those
   or this function to release the given object.

15.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a namespace of GSS-API name attributes.
   Attributes are named by OID, so no single authority might be needed
   for allocation, however, in the interest of providing the community
   with an authority for name attribute OID allocation and a way to find
   the existing set of name attributes, the IANA should establish both,
   a single OID off of which name attributes could be allocated, and a
   registry of known GSS name attributes.

   GSS-API name attribute registry entries should contain all the
   information that GSS_Inquire_name_attribute() may return about the
   given name attributes and their OIDs:

   o  a name attribute OID (this is a unique key)

   o  a name attribute symbolic name, starting with "GSS_C_NA_" (this is
      a unique key)

   o  a brief description, in English

   o  whether the attribute is useful as the subject of access control
      list entries

   o  whether the attribute is useful as an indicator of trust

   o  an optional normative reference to documentation for the given
      name attribute

   The allocation and registration policy should be first come, first
   served.  Registry entries' OIDs need not be based on the base OID
   given above.

16.  Security Considerations

   <TBA>

   [In particular, the status of a name attribute as "authenticated" vs.
   "asserted" requires close review, particularly with respect to PKIX
   certificate extensions.]
