2.  Introduction


   [NOTE: the references section is current fairly empty; the various
   KITTEN WG work items will be added to this I-D in a subsequent
   revision.]


   Since the advent of the GSS-APIv2 it has come to be used in a number
   of Internet (and other) protocols and a number of implementations
   exist.  In that time implementors and protocol designers have come to
   understand both, the GSS-API's strengths, and its shortcommings; we
   believe now that a number of extensions to the GSS-API are needed.
   Here these proposed extensions, forming what we may call the GSS-API
   version 3, are described at a high-level.;


   Some of these extensions are intended to facilitate further
   extensions, so that further major revisions to the GSS-API may not be
   necessary.  Others are intended to fill voids in the the GSS-APIv2.


   The extensions being proposed are:
      A pseudo-mechanism OID for the GSS-API itself
      Mechanism attribute inquiry facilities
      Security context extensibility extensions
      Credential extensibility extensions
      Credential export/import
      GSS_Store_cred(), for making delegated credentials available for
      acquisition
      Pseudo-mechanism stacking
      Naming extensions, to facilitate authorization by identifiers
      other than names
      Additional name types, specifically domain-based naming
      A pseudo-random function interface
      Channel bindings specifications
      Semantic extensions relating to thread- and/or fork-safety
      [Have I missed anything?  I have a feeling I have.  Re-keying?]
      ...


   Additionally, because we foresee future minor extensions, including,
   specifically, extensions which may impact the various namespaces
   associated with APIs (symbol names, constant values, class names,
   etc...) we also propose the establishment of IANA registries for
   these namespaces.

3.  A Pseudo-Mechanism OID for the GSS-API Itself


   A mechanism OID is assigned to identify and refer to the GSS-API
   iself.  This is necessary to enable the use of extended inquiry
   interfaces to inquire about features of a GSS-API implementation
   specifically, apart from actual mechanisms.


   But also, this OID is needed for better error handling, so that minor
   status codes produced in generic contexts that lack a mechanism OID
   can be distinguished from minor status codes for a "default"
   mechanism and properly displayed.

Internet-Draft           Guide to the GSS-APIv3                July 2004



4.  Mechanism Attribute Inquiry Facilities


   In the course of designing a pseudo-mechanism stacking facility, as
   well as while considering the impact of all of these extensions on
   portability, a need for interfaces through which to discover or
   inquire by features provided by GSS-API mechanisms was discovered.


   The proposed mechanism attribute inquiry interfaces consist of:
      GSS_Inquire_mech_attrs_for_mech()
      GSS_Indicate_mechs_by_mech_attrs()
      GSS_Display_mech_attr()


   These extensions facilitate portability by allowing GSS-APIv3
   applications to discover the features provided by a given
   implementation of the GSS-API or any mechanisms.  These extensions
   are also useful in facilitating stackable pseudo-mechanisms.

5.  Security Context Extensibility Extensions


   In order to facilitate future security context options we introduce a
   GSS_Create_sec_context() interface that creates a security context
   object, for use with extensions and with GSS_Init_sec_context(),
   GSS_Accept_sec_context(), and GSS_Inquire_sec_context().  Such
   security contexts are in a non-established state until they are
   established through the use of GSS_Init_sec_context() or
   GSS_Accept_sec_context().

Internet-Draft           Guide to the GSS-APIv3                July 2004



6.  Credential Extensibility Extensions


   In order to facilitate future extensions to GSS credentials we
   introduce a GSS_Create_credential(), similar to
   GSS_Create_sec_context(), interface that creates an "empty"
   credential.

Internet-Draft           Guide to the GSS-APIv3                July 2004



7.  Credential Export/Import


   To allow for passing of credentials between different "session
   contexts," between different hosts, or for storage of post-dated
   credentials, we introduce a credential export/import facility, much
   like the security context export/import facility of the GSS-APIv2.


   Together with credential extensibility and other extensions this
   facility may allow for:
      Credential delegation at any time
      Post-dated credentials, and storage of the such for subsequent
      use.
      ...?

Internet-Draft           Guide to the GSS-APIv3                July 2004



8.  GSS_Store_cred()


   This extension fills a void in the GSS-APIv2 where delegated
   credentials could not be used except in the context of the same
   process that received them.  With this extension acceptor
   applications can now make delegated credentials available for use,
   with GSS_Acquire_cred() et.  al., in other process contexts.


   [Manipulation of "credential stores" is (may be?) out of scope for
   this document.]

Internet-Draft           Guide to the GSS-APIv3                July 2004



9.  Pseudo-Mechanism Stacking


   A number of pseudo-mechanisms are being proposed which are designed
   to "stack" atop other mechanisms.  The possiblities are many,
   including: a compression mechanism, a perfect forward security
   mechanism, an many others.


   The GSS-APIv2 only had concrete mechanisms and one pseudo-mechanism
   (SPNEGO) available.  With this proposal the mechanism taxonomy is
   quite expanded:
      Concrete mechanisms (e.g., the Kerberos V mechanism)
      Composite mechanisms (a concrete mechanism composed with one or
      more stackable pseudo-mechanisms)
      Stackable pseudo-mechanisms
      Other pseudo-mechanisms (e.g., SPNEGO, the GSS-API itself)


   Although composed mechanisms may be made available for use by
   GSS-APIv2 applications without any further extensions, use of
   stackable pseudo-mechanisms can complicate mechanism negotiation;
   additionally, discovery of mechanisms appropriate for use in one or
   another context would require hard-coding information about them in
   GSS-APIv2 applications.  Extensions to the GSS-APIv2 could facilitate
   use of composite.


   The mechanism attribute inquiry facilities, together with the
   forllowing additional interfaces, provide for a complete interface to
   mechanism composition and for managing the complexity of mechanism
   negotiation:
      GSS_Compose_oid()
      GSS_Decompose_oid()
      GSS_Release_oid()
      GSS_Indicate_negotiable_mechs()
      GSS_Negotiate_mechs()

10.  Naming Extensions


   Some applications make use of exported names, as produced by
   GSS_Export_name(), to create/manage/evaluate access control lists; we
   call this name-based authorization.


   Exported names typically encode names that are meant for display to
   humans, not internal identifiers.


   In practice this creates a number of problems.  E.g., the referential
   integrity of such access control lists is hard to maintain as
   principals are added, removed, renamed or old principal names reused.


   Additionally, some mechanisms may lack a notion of a "canonical" name
   for some or all of their principals.  Such mechanisms cannot be used
   by applications that rely on name-based authorization.

14.  Semantic and Miscallaneous Extensions


   The GSS-APIv2 specifications say nothing about the thread-safety,
   much less the fork-safety, of the GSS-API.  Thread-safety and
   fork-safety are, after all, platform- and/or language-specific
   matters.  But as support for multi-threading spreads the matter of
   thread-safety cannot be avoided.  The matter of fork-safety is
   specific to platforms that provide a "fork()" function, or similar.

   <reference the portability considerations section>

15.  Portability Considerations


   The potential for additional generic, mechanism-specific, language
   binding-specific and, most importantly, semantic extensions to the
   GSS-APIv3 may create application portability problems.  The mechanism
   attribute inquiry facilities of the GSS-APIv3 and the
   pseudo-mechanism OID for the GSS-API itself double as a run-time
   facility for discovery of feature availability.  Run-time feature
   discovery facilities, in turn, can be used at application build-time
   as well by building small applications to display the available
   features.
