# Simple subunit testrunner for python

# NOTE: This is deprecated - Using the standard subunit runner is
# preferred - e.g. "python -m samba.subunit.run YOURMODULE".
#
# This wrapper will be removed once all tests can be run
# without it. At the moment there are various tests which still
# get e.g. credentials passed via command-line options to this
# script.

This runs a Samba python test suite. The tests are typically located in
python/samba/tests/*.py

To run the tests from one of those modules, specify the test as
samba.tests.MODULE. For example, to run the tests in common.py:

   subunitrun samba.tests.common

To list the tests in that module, use:

   subunitrun -l samba.tests.common

NOTE: This script is deprecated in favor of "python -m subunit.run". Don't use
it unless it can be avoided.
