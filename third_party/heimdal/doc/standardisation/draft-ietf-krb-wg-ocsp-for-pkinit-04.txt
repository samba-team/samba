Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism to enable in-band transmission of
   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses in the Kerberos
   network authentication protocol.  These responses are used to verify
   the validity of the certificates used in PKINIT - the Kerberos

Internet-Draft           OCSP Support for PKINIT            January 2005


1.  Introduction

   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [RFC2560] enables
   applications to obtain timely information regarding the revocation
   status of a certificate.  Because OCSP responses are well-bounded and
   small in size, constrained clients may wish to use OCSP to check the
   validity of the certificates for Kerberos Key Distribution Center
   (KDC) in order to avoid transmission of large Certificate Revocation
   Lists (CRLs) and therefore save bandwidth on constrained networks
   [OCSP-PROFILE].

   This document defines a pre-authentication type [CLARIFICATIONS],
   where the client and the KDC MAY piggyback OCSP responses for
   certificates used in authentication exchanges, as defined in
   [PKINIT].

   By using this OPTIONAL extension, PKINIT clients and the KDC can
   maximize the reuse of cached OCSP responses.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Message Definition

   A pre-authentication type identifier is defined for this mechanism:

              PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE              16

   The corresponding padata-value field [CLARIFICATIONS] contains the
   DER [X60] encoding of the following ASN.1 type:

          PKOcspData ::= SEQUENCE OF OcspResponse

          OcspResponse ::= OCTET STRING
                         -- contains a complete OCSP response,
                         -- defined in [RFC2560]

   The client MAY send OCSP responses for certificates used in
   PA-PK-AS-REQ [PKINIT] via a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE.

   The KDC that receives a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE then SHOULD send a
   PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE containing OCSP responses for certificates used
   in the KDC's PA-PK-AS-REP.  The client can request a
   PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE by using a PKOcspData containing an empty
   sequence.

   The KDC MAY send a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE when it does not receive a
   PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE from the client.

   The PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE sent by the KDC contains OCSP responses for
   certificates used in PA-PK-AS-REP [PKINIT].

   Note the lack of integrity protection for the empty or missing OCSP
   response; lack of an expected OCSP response from the KDC for the
   KDC's certificates SHOULD be treated as an error by the client,
   unless it is configured otherwise.

   When using OCSP, the response is signed by the OCSP server, which is
   trusted by the receiver.  Depending on local policy, further
   verification of the validity of the OCSP servers may be needed

   The client and the KDC SHOULD ignore invalid OCSP responses received
   via this mechanism, and they MAY implement CRL processing logic as a
   fall-back position, if the OCSP responses received via this mechanism
   alone are not sufficient for the verification of certificate
   validity.  The client and/or the KDC MAY ignore a valid OCSP response
   and perform their own revocation status verification independently.

4.  Security Considerations

   The pre-authentication data in this document do not actually
   authenticate any principals, but is designed to be used in
   conjunction with PKINIT.

   There is no binding between PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE pre-authentication
   data and PKINIT pre-authentication data other than a given OCSP
   response corresponding to a certificate used in a PKINIT
   pre-authentication data element.  Attacks involving removal or
   replacement of PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE pre-authentication data elements
   are, at worst, downgrade attacks, where a PKINIT client or KDC would
   proceed without use of CRLs or OCSP for certificate validation, or
   denial of service attacks, where a PKINIT client or KDC that cannot
   validate the other's certificate without an accompanying OCSP
   response might reject the AS exchange or where they might have to
   download very large CRLs in order to continue.  Kerberos V does not
   protect against denial-of-service attacks, therefore the
   denial-of-service aspect of these attacks are acceptable.

   If a PKINIT client or KDC cannot validate certificates without the
   aid of a valid PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE then it SHOULD fail the AS
   exchange, possibly according to local configuration.
