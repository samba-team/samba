.Sh CERTIFICATE STORES
Stores of certificates and/or keys have string names that can be
used with
.Nm 's
commands as well as in various configuration parameters and
command-line arguments of Heimdal's Kerberos implementation (for
PKINIT).
.Pp
For example,
.Ql FILE:/path/to/file ,
.Ql PEM-FILE:/path/to/file ,
.Ql DER-FILE:/path/to/file ,
etc.
See below for a full list of store types.
.Pp
A certificate store name starts with a store TYPE followed by a
colon followed by a name of form specific to that store type.
.Pp
Private keys can be stored in the same stores as the certificates
that certify their public keys.
.Pp
Private keys can also be stored in separate files, but still be
referenced in one certificate store name by joining two with a
comma:
.Ql FILE:/path/to/certificate,/path/to/private/key
.
.Pp
Heimdal supports a variety of certificate and private key store
types:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It PEM-FILE:/path
If writing, PEM will be written (private keys may be written in
algorithm-specific formats or in PKCS#8).
If reading, PEM will be expected (private keys may be in
algorithm-specific formats or in PKCS#8).
.It DER-FILE:/path
If writing, DER will be written.
If reading, DER will be expected.
Private keys will be in algorithm-specific formats.
.It FILE:/path
If writing, PEM will be written as if
.Ql PEM-FILE
had been used.
If reading, PEM or DER will be detected and read as if
.Ql PEM-FILE
or
.Ql DER-FILE
had been used.
.It PKCS12:/path
If writing, PKCS#12 will be written.
If reading, PKCS#12 will be expected.
Note that PKCS#12 support is currently very limited.
.It DIR:/path
OpenSSL-style hashed directory of trust anchors.
.It KEYCHAIN:system-anchors
On OS X this refers to the system's trust anchors.
.It KEYCHAIN:FILE:/path
On OS X this refers to an OS X keychain at the given path.
.It PKCS11:/path/to/shared/object[,slot=NUMBER]
Loads the given PKCS#11 provider object and uses the token at the
given slot number, or else the first token found.
.It NULL:
An empty store.
.It MEMORY:name
An in-memory only, ephemeral store, usually never used in
.NM 's
commands.
The MEMORY store name exists primarily for internal
.Sq hx509
APIs.
.El
.Pp
Use the
.Nm certificate-copy
command to copy certificates from one store to another.
This is useful for, e.g., converting DER files to PEM or
vice-versa, removing private keys, adding certificate chains,
and removing root certificates from chains.
.Sh CERTIFICATES
You can validate a certificate with the
.Nm validate
sub-command, or verify a certificate and its certification path
with the
.Nm verify
sub-command.
.Pp
You can display a certificate using the
.Nm print 
sub-command:
.Pp
.Nm print
.Oo options Oc
.Ar STORE
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Fl Fl content
.It Fl Fl info
.It Fl Fl never-fail
.It Fl Fl pass=password
.It Fl Fl raw-json
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl pass=password
option is for PKCS#8 (PEM), PKCS#12 and PKCS#11 stores, and if
needed and not given, will be prompted for.
Note that it's not secure to pass passwords as command-line
arguments on multi-tenant systems.
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl raw-json
option prints the certificate(s) in the given
.Ar STORE
as a JSON dump of their DER using an experimental (i.e.,
unstable) schema.
.Sh KEYS
The
.Nm generate-key
sub-command will generate a key.
.Sh CERTIFICATE SIGNING REQUESTS
The
.Nm request-create
sub-command will create a CSR, and has support for requesting
subject alternative names and extended key usage extensions.
See its
.Fl Fl help
option, and see
.Sx EXAMPLES
below.
.Pp
The
.Nm request-print
sub-command will display a CSR.
.Sh CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE / CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY
The
.Nm certificate-sign
sub-command will issue a certificate.
See its usage message.
.Sh ONLINE CERTIFICATE STATUS PROTOCOL
The
.Nm ocsp-fetch
sub-command will fetch OCSP Responses for the given
certificates.
.Pp
The
.Nm ocsp-verify
sub-command will verify OCSP Responses.
.Pp
The
.Nm ocsp-print
sub-command will display OCSP Responses.
.Sh CERTIFICATE REVOCATION LIST
The
.Nm crl-sign
sub-command will add certificates to a certificate revocation
list.
